the crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
breakin days on the set no sweat
drunk off moet cant bag yet because its still wet
but when that dry baggin five at a time

stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind dovell fall in love with a whore

my desert ease make mcs freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats they just dreams
you still apoligizin analyzin my size and your size and
realizin a fist fight would be asinine

we can hook up all i see is the future

your game on track not your wig pushed back
rule nombre uno never let no one know

number five never sell no crack where you rest at
i dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
number six that god damn credit dead it
you think a crackhead payin you back shit forget it
seven this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely seperated
money and blood dont mix like two dicks and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit
number eight never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
number nine shoulda been number one to me

picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched so many biggie backed off of 
biggies back and pacs landmarks history in rap
statistically in fact its so sad to see us reenact
these tragic events which lead us back
to where we left off on march th
to come from such hard knock lifes
and make it up out of em hit the spotlights
and once theyre on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest must be the strongest 
in this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
its origin which is usually originated from cats who starvin
or it could just be somebodys horror that just horrifies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entourage that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that hes gangster
he aint just say shit you just believe it
  
since bib taught us niggaz to think big
im been about my business since then so anxious 
it aint how we live its what he said he did it for brooklyn
this i took in sent chills through my skin
vicious im experiencin the same sights as him
its what excited obie to write these poems
rollin goin through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so theres no limit in them skies
when ready to die was a sick part of my life 
palmin that fortyfive plottin to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican id so many times rewind
got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
get up out the system who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly id be popular huh 
thats the inspiration i got from my nigga bi
  
i took him from coal to diamond i molded his mind
enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
i made a frankenstein my design impressed
backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
critics lashed said i made a fortune off of his passin 
all i did was build a dynasty off of his passion
and im addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
the original king of new york christopher wallace
this is a promise on diddys honor im a father tyanna
and teach her that with all the drama dont even bother

niggaz is never happy til theres blood up in your mouth
theres a lot of killers but who the hell are you to play in this
a lot are dead how the hell you take the pain
live with it got money you better get with it
my man had the thug in him did his bid with it
get married to the game but never have a kid with it
advice from the wise slice the pies
too many schemes divides when dreams collide
teams provide war for the street to absorb
stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind dovell fall in love with a whore
uhh uhh uhh
who the fuck wanna squeeze
my desert ease make mcs freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats they just dreams
you still apoligizin analyzin my size and your size and
realizin a fist fight would be asinine

genuine steel piece nozzle in your grill piece
youre shook up two bricks every cook up
we can hook up all i see is the future

by the way them bricks get flipped weekly
sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
die for a dollar nigga life aint sweet
play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
i be the mob fiance about to marry it
illegal transactions in farragut with arabics

number five never sell no crack where you rest at
i dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
number six that god damn credit dead it
you think a crackhead payin you back shit forget it
seven this rule is so underrated

picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched so many biggie backed off of 
biggies back and pacs landmarks history in rap
statistically in fact its so sad to see us reenact
these tragic events which lead us back
to where we left off on march th
to come from such hard knock lifes
and make it up out of em hit the spotlights
and once theyre on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest must be the strongest 
in this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
its origin which is usually originated from cats who starvin
or it could just be somebodys horror that just horrifies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entourage that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that hes gangster
he aint just say shit you just believe it
  
since bib taught us niggaz to think big
im been about my business since then so anxious 
it aint how we live its what he said he did it for brooklyn
this i took in sent chills through my skin
vicious im experiencin the same sights as him
its what excited obie to write these poems
rollin goin through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so theres no limit in them skies
when ready to die was a sick part of my life 
palmin that fortyfive plottin to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican id so many times rewind

get up out the system who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly id be popular huh 
thats the inspiration i got from my nigga bi
  
i took him from coal to diamond i molded his mind
enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
i made a frankenstein my design impressed
backpackers and press who said my house was a mess

all i did was build a dynasty off of his passion
and im addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is

and my bitch swear to god she wont snitch

grab my vest grab my gun to find out the problem
when i pulled up police was on the scene

drove down the block stashed the burner in the bushes
stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
it didnt take long before the tears start
i saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart

while you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
compose your own sheets thats aight but chill
ima spend that mil and cop only hot shit

niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
underground all above must get shot
you couldnt book me dano sheek luciano put the burners
to all yall what nigga bring it im callin yall
you already know what its about when i run up in your house
put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
hearin you out is senseless perhaps for instance
i give this faggot a french kiss

either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
lox and poppa turning niggaz into jim hoffa

you gettin money or your runnin from the feds
aint nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head
and i solemnly swear
that all yall niggaz out there got a problem this year
before you think of keepin me down heatin me down
the flow like water get deepe and you drown
with no soul many niggaz roll with no dough
even the small dunn got a little black hole
your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
niggaz is never happy til theres blood up in your mouth
theres a lot of killers but who the hell are you to play in this
a lot are dead how the hell you take the pain
live with it got money you better get with it
my man had the thug in him did his bid with it
get married to the game but never have a kid with it
advice from the wise slice the pies
too many schemes divides when dreams collide
teams provide war for the street to absorb
stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind dovell fall in love with a whore
uhh uhh uhh
who the fuck wanna squeeze
my desert ease make mcs freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats they just dreams
you still apoligizin analyzin my size and your size and
realizin a fist fight would be asinine
you just pop wines i must pop nines
genuine steel piece nozzle in your grill piece
youre shook up two bricks every cook up
we can hook up all i see is the future
disrespect i shoot ya
by the way them bricks get flipped weekly
sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
die for a dollar nigga life aint sweet
play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
i be the mob fiance about to marry it
illegal transactions in farragut with arabics
why not they fit twelve up in the bedroom
imagine what they stash is like make you a classic like
my first lp beef with me is unhealthy
fuck around and get an ulcer loose your pulse or
collapsed lung look how many gats i brung
for them homos still doin promos

i dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce

by some bitch named alberta over nickelplated burners
and my bitch swear to god she wont snitch
i told her when she hit the bricks ill make the hooker rich

chorus

chorus   
ih ih ih 
it has been it has been it has been
it has been said that there has been known to be bloodshed
over bread men who have bled to death dead 
strapped to beds pipe bombs dynamite lead
money power respect street cred yeah
its scary aint it picture yourself goin out as a hero 
picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched so many biggie backed off of 
biggies back and pacs landmarks history in rap
statistically in fact its so sad to see us reenact
these tragic events which lead us back
to where we left off on march th
to come from such hard knock lifes
and make it up out of em hit the spotlights
and once theyre on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest must be the strongest 
in this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
its origin which is usually originated from cats who starvin
or it could just be somebodys horror that just horrifies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entourage that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that hes gangster
he aint just say shit you just believe it
  
since bib taught us niggaz to think big
im been about my business since then so anxious 
it aint how we live its what he said he did it for brooklyn
this i took in sent chills through my skin
vicious im experiencin the same sights as him
its what excited obie to write these poems
rollin goin through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so theres no limit in them skies
when ready to die was a sick part of my life 
palmin that fortyfive plottin to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican id so many times rewind
got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
get up out the system who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly id be popular huh 
thats the inspiration i got from my nigga bi
  
i took him from coal to diamond i molded his mind
enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
i made a frankenstein my design impressed
backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
critics lashed said i made a fortune off of his passin 
all i did was build a dynasty off of his passion
and im addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
the original king of new york christopher wallace
this is a promise on diddys honor im a father tyanna
and teach her that with all the drama dont even bother
on repeat all of your albums play back to back 
and i visit your grave cause our friendships intact
an immaculate concept extravagant progress
bullet wounds left in my heart im yellin god bless
regardless to critics yellin that eastwest
i seen the game losin im just pressin the reset

niggaz is never happy til theres blood up in your mouth
theres a lot of killers but who the hell are you to play in this
a lot are dead how the hell you take the pain
live with it got money you better get with it
my man had the thug in him did his bid with it
get married to the game but never have a kid with it
advice from the wise slice the pies
too many schemes divides when dreams collide
teams provide war for the street to absorb
stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind dovell fall in love with a whore
uhh uhh uhh
who the fuck wanna squeeze
my desert ease make mcs freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats they just dreams
you still apoligizin analyzin my size and your size and
realizin a fist fight would be asinine

genuine steel piece nozzle in your grill piece
youre shook up two bricks every cook up
we can hook up all i see is the future
disrespect i shoot ya
by the way them bricks get flipped weekly
sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
die for a dollar nigga life aint sweet
play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
i be the mob fiance about to marry it
illegal transactions in farragut with arabics

your game on track not your wig pushed back
rule nombre uno never let no one know
how much dough you hold cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy specially

hoodie to mask up shit for that fast buck
she be layin in the bushes to light that ass up
number four know you heard this before
never get high on your own supply
number five never sell no crack where you rest at
i dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
number six that god damn credit dead it
you think a crackhead payin you back shit forget it
seven this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely seperated
money and blood dont mix like two dicks and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit
number eight never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
number nine shoulda been number one to me
if you aint gettin bags stay the fuck from police

picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched so many biggie backed off of 
biggies back and pacs landmarks history in rap
statistically in fact its so sad to see us reenact
these tragic events which lead us back
to where we left off on march th
to come from such hard knock lifes
and make it up out of em hit the spotlights
and once theyre on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest must be the strongest 
in this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
its origin which is usually originated from cats who starvin
or it could just be somebodys horror that just horrifies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entourage that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that hes gangster
he aint just say shit you just believe it
  
since bib taught us niggaz to think big
im been about my business since then so anxious 
it aint how we live its what he said he did it for brooklyn
this i took in sent chills through my skin
vicious im experiencin the same sights as him
its what excited obie to write these poems
rollin goin through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so theres no limit in them skies
when ready to die was a sick part of my life 
palmin that fortyfive plottin to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican id so many times rewind
got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
get up out the system who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly id be popular huh 
thats the inspiration i got from my nigga bi
  
i took him from coal to diamond i molded his mind
enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
i made a frankenstein my design impressed
backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
critics lashed said i made a fortune off of his passin 
all i did was build a dynasty off of his passion
and im addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
the original king of new york christopher wallace
this is a promise on diddys honor im a father tyanna

niggaz is never happy til theres blood up in your mouth
theres a lot of killers but who the hell are you to play in this
a lot are dead how the hell you take the pain
live with it got money you better get with it
my man had the thug in him did his bid with it
get married to the game but never have a kid with it
advice from the wise slice the pies
too many schemes divides when dreams collide
teams provide war for the street to absorb
stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind dovell fall in love with a whore
uhh uhh uhh
who the fuck wanna squeeze
my desert ease make mcs freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats they just dreams
you still apoligizin analyzin my size and your size and
realizin a fist fight would be asinine

genuine steel piece nozzle in your grill piece
youre shook up two bricks every cook up
we can hook up all i see is the future

by the way them bricks get flipped weekly
sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
die for a dollar nigga life aint sweet
play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
i be the mob fiance about to marry it
illegal transactions in farragut with arabics

i dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
number six that god damn credit dead it

picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched so many biggie backed off of 
biggies back and pacs landmarks history in rap
statistically in fact its so sad to see us reenact
these tragic events which lead us back
to where we left off on march th
to come from such hard knock lifes
and make it up out of em hit the spotlights
and once theyre on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest must be the strongest 
in this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
its origin which is usually originated from cats who starvin
or it could just be somebodys horror that just horrifies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entourage that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that hes gangster
he aint just say shit you just believe it
  
since bib taught us niggaz to think big
im been about my business since then so anxious 
it aint how we live its what he said he did it for brooklyn
this i took in sent chills through my skin
vicious im experiencin the same sights as him
its what excited obie to write these poems
rollin goin through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so theres no limit in them skies
when ready to die was a sick part of my life 
palmin that fortyfive plottin to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican id so many times rewind
got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
get up out the system who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly id be popular huh 
thats the inspiration i got from my nigga bi
  
i took him from coal to diamond i molded his mind
enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
i made a frankenstein my design impressed
backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
critics lashed said i made a fortune off of his passin 
all i did was build a dynasty off of his passion
and im addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
the original king of new york christopher wallace
this is a promise on diddys honor im a father tyanna
and teach her that with all the drama dont even bother
