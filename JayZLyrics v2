but these mills well they make me hot  yall dont feel me
enough to stop the illin right
but at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
im so confused okay im gettin weeded now
i know i contradicted myself look i dont need that now 
its just once in a blue and its nothin to do and
the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through

i freed my mind sometimes i here myself moanin
take one more toke then i leave that weed alone man
it got me goin shit
  repeat xthis shit is wicked on these mean streets
none of my friends speak
were all trying to win but then again
maybe its for the best though cause when theyre seeing too much
you know theyre trying to get you touched
whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldnt understand the mechanics
and the workings of the underworld granted
nine to five is how to survive i aint trying to survive
im trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
life ills poison my body
i used to say fuck mic skills
and never prayed to god i prayed to gotti
thats right its wicked thats life i live it
aint asking for forgiveness for my sins ends
i break bread with the late heads picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the gamell do
it gets dangerous money and power is changing us
and now were lethal infected with devils
we used to fight for building blocks
now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
the closest of friends when we first started
but grew apart as the money grew and soon grew blackhearted
thinkin back when we first learned to use rubbers
he never learned so in turn im kidnappin his babys mother
my hand around her collar feeding her cheese
she said the taste of dollars was shitty so i fed her fifties
about his whereabouts i wasnt convinced
so i kept feedin her money til her shit started to make sense
who could ever foresee we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
now im tryin to rock this bitch to sleep
all the years we were real close
now i see his fears through her tears
know shes wishin we were still close
dont cry it is to be
in time ill take away your miseries and make em mine devils
my flesh no nigga could test
my soul is possessed by devils in the form of diamonds and lexuses
the exorcist got me doing skits like homie
you dont know me but the whole world owe me  strip
was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
so now im down for whatever aint nothing nice
throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
but now this higher learning got the remy in me
liquors invaded my kidneys
got me ready to lick off mama forgive me
i cant be held accountable devils beatin me down boo
got me runnin with guys making gs tellin lies that sound true
come test me i never cower
for the love of money son im giving lead showers

look if i shoot you im brainless
but if you shoot me then youre famous  whats a ngga to do
when the streets is watching blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it thats the fastest way to get extorted
but my time is money at twentyfive i cant afford it
beef is sorted like godiva chocolates
nggaz you bought it i pull the slide back and cock it
plan aborted you and your mans get a pass
this rhyme youre operating on fck time
yall nggaz aint worth my shells all yall nggaz
tryin to do is hurt my sales and stop trips to john mcnale
the type to start a beef then run to the cops
when i see you in the street got one in the drop
when id rather be on tour gettin a hundred a pop
taking pictures with some btches in front of the drop
the streets is watching
when the streets is watching
blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it
now its hard not to kill nggaz
its like a full time job not to kill nggaz cant chill
the streets is watchin when you froze your arms
nggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm
cant get caught with your feet up gotta keep your heat up
sweet nggaz running round swearing sht is sweeter
once youre tagged lame the game is follow the leader
everybody want a piece of your scrilla so you gotta keep it realer
kidnap nggaz wanna steal ya
broke nggaz want no cash they just wanna kill ya
for the name nggaz dont know the rules
disrespectin the game want you to blow your cool
force your hand of course that mans plottin
smarten up the streets is watchin its on
my street mentality flip bricks forever know me and money
we like armed codefendants ngga we stick together
sht whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
hustle harder to see it if indictment time came around
and you can look up and down the streets and i cant be found
put in twentyfour hour shifts but that aint me now
got a face too easy to trace nggaz mouths got slow leaks
had to hide between my workers couldnt play those streets
she out of space like mercury you jerkin me  hectic
had to call upon my wolves to send nggaz the message
i said this lets play fair and we can stay here
im trying to transform you boyz ii men like daycare
hey theres money to be made and nggaz got the picture
stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
then hard times fell upon us half of my staff
had warrants the other half in the casket lay dormant
i felt like life was cheating me for the first time
in my life i was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me
was this a lesson god teaching me  was he saying that
im playing the game straight from hell from which few came back
like bad coke pimp or die was my mindframe bad
was nggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack
aint a whole lot of brain to that just trying to maintain a stack
and not collide like two trains thats on the same track         
but get my life together like the oars i bring back
in the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
got my transporter take it cross the border then stop
to set up shop with a quarter of rock  heres the plan
for three straight weeks nggaz slaughtered the block
but you know the game is lluted fcked up me and my dues
one drop can wipe a ngga out faster than the cops
and this unstable way of living just had to stop
half of my nggaz got time we done real things
by ninetyfour became the subject of half of yall nggaz rhymes
public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street
but thats the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets
the life and times of a demonic mind excited with crime
and the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
i figured sht why risk myself i just write it in rhymes
and let you feel me and if you dont like it then fine
the mindstate of a ngga who boosted the crime rate
so high in one city they send national guards to get me
ya dig
the streetsverse one
im done talking
ran up in the spot gun smoking
shot it in the air one woke him
sunsoaking sweating in his bed like dunlo
thinking to himself what done provoked him
his thoughts is racing like a vulcan
i swear i saw a lightbulb when
he finally figured out who was the culprit
i said yeah remember me from friend or foe when
i told you dont ever ever come around here no more
time to pay now you try to rise i wave the gun  lay down
this time youre really going to listen to jay now
i try to talk sensibly hoping that eventually you realize
i had this locked and it just wasnt meant to be
plus i had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
and it wasnt afterthought that maybe youll try to revenge me
but i was like nah chromes had to know he was wrong
and if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
plus you promised
and thats really no fun 
yeah i find you in this motel  with all these guns
and all your goons lined up in adjoining rooms
like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
but my minds like a flower in bloom
 my eyes just scower the room
im alert plus i paid the clerk i got it laid out
you think you the first nigga i played out in a  hotel town 
come on now i peep your lexus at you
left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
money well invested rudely interrupted
jamaican accents  
a gun in your face and thats all you can come up with
im done talking back up and clap them one in the abdomen 
do me a favor dude get  ice cubes i pass them
take that ice up for the nicest mc
and please yo tell big hes unbelievable 
friend or foe biotchhow can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in
theres gotta be them times youll be wrong nah mean
how can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga 
he never even met that he dont even know and shit
i think this rap shit is all beef
yall dont even know every day im livin with stress
got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
cant even enjoy myself at a party unless
im on the dance floor hot ass vest
you think im freakin these chicks right
itry not to brush against they chest
you get a lawsuit for shit like that i feel trapped
swear to everything when i leave this earth
its gon be on both feet never knees in the dirt
you could try me fucka but when i squeeze it hurts fine
well lose two lives yours and mines
gimme any amount of time dont let ms carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin tears on my sleeve
told the judge didnt budge it was him or me
and i aint trying to be hard but im guilty as charged
put my mercy on this court and my faith in god 
and pray hard none of my nephews wanna be starslucky me
chorus karen anderson
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
i hate all girls with alterior motives
thats why im twenty plus years old no sons no daughters
hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
hear the hate in my voice right i hate that you noticed
niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
hate a nigga like that faggot get your own
hate that i cant roam the street without the clip and chrome
knowing one day ima have to flip cmon
you know the shit dont stop til the crist dont pop
and you have to kill a nigga and your wrist dont lock
im trapped the whole worlds against me in fact
it aint no turning back bring it on
hate the price of fame cause it cost too much
can i live without yall niggas saying i floss too much
hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
steady looking for flaws through us lucky me
chorus karen anderson jayz
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me 
and now that ive arrived
i see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold
nigga see you in the street pretend to be friendly
but i know any type of success breeds envy

just a breeze not enough to catch a real vibe
then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five

cuts and scratchesuhhuh jeje jejejeah 
yeyeyeah yeyeyeah
how real is this how real is this
uhhuh huh inspect this here check
verse one
im from where the hammers rung news cameras never come
you and your man houndin every verse in your rhyme
where the grams is slung niggas vanish every summer
where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can and run
where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
to achieve this goal quicker sold all my weight wet
faced with immeasurable odds still i get straight bets
so i felt some more something and you nothing check
i from the other side with other guys dont walk to much
and girls in the projects wouldnt fuck us if we talked too much
so they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
i dont know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us
im from where the beef is inevitable summertimes unforgetable
boosters in abundance buy a halfprice sweater new
your world was everything so everything you said youd do
you did it couldnt talk about it if you aint lived it
i from where niggas pull your car and argue all day about
whos the best mcs biggie jayz and nas
where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
at each others throats for the love of foreign cars
where cats catch cases hoping the judge r and rs
but most times find themselves locked up behind bars
im from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
im from marcy son just thought id remind yall
chorus 
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
mentally been many places but im brooklyns own
verse two
im from the place where the chruch is the flakiest
and niggas is praying to god so long that they atheist
where you cant put your vest away and say youll wear it tomorrow
cause the day after well be saying damn i was just with him yesterday
im a block away from hell not enough shots away from straight shells
an ounce away from a triple beam still using a handheld weight scale
your laughing you know the place well
where the liqour stores and the base well
and government fuck government niggas polotic themselves
where we call the cops the ateam
cause they hop out of vans and spray things
and life expectancy so low we making out wills at eightteen
where how you get rid of guys who step out of line your rep solidifies
so tell me when i rap you think i give a fuck who criticize
if the shit is lies god strike me
and i got a question are you forgiving guys who live just like me
well never know
one day i pray to you and said if i ever blow let em know
mistakes aint exactly what takes place in the ghetto
promise fulfilled but still i feel my job aint done
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
chorus 
verse three
im from where they crossover and clap boards
lost jehovah in place of rap lords listen
im up the block round the corner and down the street
from where the pimps prostitutes and the drug lords meet
we make a million off of beats cause our stories is deep
and fuck tomorrow as long as the night before was sweet
niggas get lost for weeks in the streets twisted off weed
and no matter the weather niggas know how to draw heat
whether your fourfeet or minute size it always starts out with
three dice and shoot the five
niggas thought they douce was live now hit em with trips
and i reached down for their money pa forget about this
this time around its platinum like the shit on my wrist
and this glock on my waist yall cant do shit about this
niggas will show you love thats how they fool thugs
before you know it your lying in a pool of blood
chorus kelly price 
talking throughout my life 
no matter what ive done
youve been merciful and your love endureth 
through all things  for that
i am eternally grateful
verse 
since my date of birth
bought you nothing but hurt
play those video games
stole change from ya purse
sat on the cold court bench
til i was arraigned in ya skirt
saw the pain in ya face
through you maintained a smirk
all you did was motivate me
dont let em hold you back
what i do i turned around
and i sold you crack
i was a bastard for that
still im drowning in shame
just remember one thing now
youre not to blame
you was newly seperated
tryin to escape ya world
and through my thirst
i didnt help you
i just made things worse
i hated me and everybody
that created crack
had me thinkin
the newest kicks and the latest gat
still havent apologized
so please play this back
while i try to come to terms
with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way
cocaine numbs the brain
all i did was think about
how the funds once came
then i ran across this memory 
and it stung the brain
how can you ever destroy the beauty
from which one came
thats a savage youre the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why i rhyme above average and
i aint shit
glad you got yourself together
no thanks to me
strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
you must love me
chorus  
say that you love me
all i know say that you must love me
ohh yeah
verse 
we used to fight every night
but i never would suffer
just smile my big brothers
tryna make me tougher
as we grew fussing and fighting continued
as i plundered through ya stuff
and snuck ya clothes to school
got intense real intense
as we got older
never believed it would lead
to be popped in one of ya shoulda
with my rings knew you had it
cause you took too long
as mickey andy and the girl that bought it looked on
huffin and puffin gun in my hand
told you step outside
hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
made our way down the steps
maybe you thought it was just a threat
or maybe ya life was just that crazy
and you was beggin for death
try to justify this in my young mind
but ya drillin it
and my ego hurt combined
drove me berzerk
saw the devil in your eyes
high off more than weed
confused i just closed
my young eyes and squeezed sorry boys
but all the money in the world couldnt bring me back again
lay down lay down
gonna stretch my mic out in ponce funeral home on marcy
all those new niggaz stop there
but a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
the last of the real hustlers well
maybe not the last
bleeks gonna be a good rapper
new improved jayz

inspect the game yo thats right
 last week i had everything
 i had the money had the cars the bitches
 and the jewelry
	and then my motherfuckin niggaz started snitchin
 beyotch
growin up in the hood just my dog and me
we used to hustle in the hood for all to see
problems i called on him he called on me
we wasnt quite partners i hit him off my p
met him unlocked doors off my keys
yeah we spoke much more than cordially
man he broke bread with me my business spread swiftly
the feds came to get me we both fled quickly
wasnt quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
got caught and thats when our relationship strayed
used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
and when he called collect and i heard his name
i quickly accepted but when i reached the phone
hes talkin reckless i can sense deceit in his tone
i said damn dawg what nine weeks and youre home
he said main man you think shits sweet cause youre home
i just sat spat no more speech in the phone
the crackers up there bleachin your dome youre reachin
i said the world dont stop ive got to keep keep on
from there i sensed the beef was on
i ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
to see if i had bugs and leeches on my phone
cant be too safe cause niggaz is twofaced
and they show the other side when they catch a new case
its on
it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i dont see how this side of you could be provoked
funny what seven days can change
a stand up nigga now you sit down to aim
used to have a firm grip now you droppin names
uhhuh uhhuh 
like i put the toast to your head and made you sell
we both came in this game blind as hell
i did a little better had more clientele
told you put away some cheddar now you cryin for bail
seventeen and im holdin on to around a mill
i could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill
had niggaz thinkin i was from uptown for real
i had so much hustle plus i was down to ill
like a brooklyn nigga straight out of brownsville
down and dirty down to fight the round thirty
freezin on them corners still holdin my crack
lookin up and down the block the fuck is the dough at
came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
you tell them feds i said im never goin back
im from marcy and marcy dont raise no rats
you know the consequences of your acts you cant be serious
the lawyer i retained you said you leakin some things
all this after a week in the bang
im mad at myself cause i didnt spot the weak and lame
i woulda bet the house you wouldnt speak a thang
nigga this was the oath to the top of broke
even pricked our finger anything that got between us
we sposed to cock the ninas what happened to that
instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
fuck it the same thing make you laugh make you cry
thats right the same game that make you mad could make you die
its a dice game and sometimes you crap
who woulda thought youd get popped one time and rap
now you know thats bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up like this is my dad
the labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
youll always be in jail nigga just minus the bars
shit is crazy man
all these niggaz out here snitchin
we was one step away from takin this crack money
and recyclin it through the ghettoes
and buildin back up our own hoods
now all you niggaz start snitchin on each other

i felt his hatred it was harsh fore this fakin shit start
i should take him in back of the building and blaze him
uhoh this nigga jay he aint slow he musta picked up on the vibe
and had i not been so high i woulda been able to hide
tried to cover up myself as i gave him a five
hugged him as if i loved him
to the naked eye
it woulda seemed we was the closest but to those that know us
could see that somethin was about to go down
stay focused
im tryin to concentrate but its like hes reading my mind
as if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
could he see i had plans on bein the man
ever since we first spoke and he put that g in my hand
and i gave it back to show him i was down for the cause
as he approached  and i paused

	serena altschuls here live outside the criminal courthouse
	this is  yall
	in new york city for the first day in the trial of 
	im gone 
	the state vs shawn carter aka jayz
	uhh uhhuhuh uhh uhhuhuh uhh
	whatever the verdict in this trial may be
	the effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide
aiyyo stand forward fore you take notice
or witness to me killin the track
testify til me spillin the smack
now they got me for traffickin racketeerin audio crack
	they call me dope man dope man
	i try to tell em im where hope floats man
	ghetto spokesman
a broke man approachin the bench with intent
to bury me under the cell fingered me as the toast man
evidence stemmin from ninetysix
they say the world aint recovered from his fix
while they was usin cut i was on some other shit
gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
nowaday the jury got they brow raised
listenin to testimony about my foul ways
exhibit a reasonable doubt
they say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
	you can feel the tension building here
	as an unprecedented number of people have turned out
	for what may be the trial of the century
how come you label your brand of dope
volume  and spread it through the slums
fed it to the young with total disregard
your honor the state seeks the maximum charge
and how could you turn right around
and release a lethal dosage called volume 
and is true you operate the criminal enterprise
known as rocafella in charge of his meteoric rise
and do you deny youre responsible for the demise
of record execs and do you object
your distributions polygram and through your connects
def jam you pushed over five million soundscan
and not to mention your cohorts and henchmen
dame biggs lyor kev and russell simmons
and we aint gon talk about murder inc
that just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
	the state is seeking the maximum penalty
	and with the overwhelming amount of evidence
	the das presented things arent looking good
	despite the grim outlook at this point
	the rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
	in the face of adversity
	jayz is taking the stand
right hand on the bible left hand in the air
before i spoke one word made sure my throat was clear
ahem im a prisoner of circumstance
frail nigga i couldnt much work with my hands
but my mind was strong i grew where you hold your blacks up
trap us expect us not to pick gats up
where you drop your cracks off by the mack trucks
destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
keep us spiralin goin backwards
at age nine saw my first hate crime
blindfolded expected to walk a straight line
mind molded taught to love you and hate mine
climbed over it at a early age jay shined
fuck the system at lady justice i blaze nine
your honor i no longer kill my people i raise mine
the soul of mumia in this modern day time

	outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation

im ready to make this one of the hottest summer there is
everyday like a hundredandsix shit
chorus x
motherfuckerswho ever thought young shawn carter would change the game
used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
duckin the plain cops pushin indo and caine
at the kitchen table late night no pen just my brain
first album niggaz love me cause they thought i was poor
guess im successful industry dont love me no more
well im the same nigga from your corner bubblin raw
skully tilted pants saggin damn near touchin the floor
and i come with dorags to your socalled awards

hold me tight and call me your lady  
let me scream your name
i took ya outta jacobs in clusters
busters they wanted to rush us
love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
when you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
you can light up the whole room turning day from night
when the summertime is in and the tops are down
with you around my neck we lock the whole block down 
it took shortsleeves and loungin to understand
the reason they call you ice everybody freeze
aint a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
and that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
the direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
i used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
guess i was jealous that they was so next to you
so i devoted half my time to invest in you
the other half was spent on protecting you
cause you belong to me now sing ya song for me
cmon
chorus x
im often with you so they wonder bout the juice i got
i took you from the projects and an abusive pops
from the bottom to the top
the skateboard to the drop
from the nada to the prada
i got ya like i got ya
from the first time i put you round my neck and locked ya
it was then i knew everywhere i went youd follow
soon i spent every dolla you became my habit
other brothers vice was smoke mines was carats
the more checks i got the more i laced my crew
the rocks got bigger watch face got blue
tricked a little bit shit i lace my boo
fuck it my mistress i laced her too
cop my jewels twice like deja vu
if they ever met in the mall its ova yall

i mean the thugs love ya when your girls best friend
chorus x
and the wedding band you love
in the gold chain you thug
sometimes you given just because
and the tennis bracelet means they want relations

you find a dude in town you send him a short message
say hey im new in town i dont know my way around

i get that butter all night
cause most niggaz dont know a brick from a bike
they keep buyin hard white
and if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
fyi i never been robbed in my life
or  you find a chick shit you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you round town like her man
shake hands make friends like its all innocent
then  before they look up you sellin the town cookup
or  gorilla pimp come up on that killer shit
take a nigga brick smack him then you sell it back to them

uh huhyeah yeahmotherfuckers 
say that im foolish i only talk about jewels 
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothin i made somethin doin
what i do through and through and
i give you the news  with a twist its just his ghetto pointofview
the renegade you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture bring em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no hes not around  now how that sound to ya jot it down
i bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
i help them see they way through it  not you
cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth you lose your tie and your shirt
since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it with em a minute
cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference  theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict  like you didnt experiment
now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin dogooders  too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
 and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go  hes 
and im the sinister mr kissmyass its just the
 renegade  never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a renegade  never been afraid to talk
about anything  anything  renegade
 never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a  never been afraid to holler
about anything  anything 
i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
whatchu hollerin gotta pay rent bring dollars in
by the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
doorag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me  im awkward i box leftier often
my pops left me an orphan my momma wasnt home
could not stress to me i wasnt grown specially on nights
i brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor  thirty years my senior
my childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky
big i did it  multi before i die 
no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight
see im a poet to some a regular modern day shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatterbrained atheist
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter  a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see its easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water  no wonder they try to hold me under longer
im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube  motherfuckers hate to like you

okay lets do this 
things just aint the same for gangsters
but im a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
all of these rap singers claimin they bangers
doin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin the game no home trainin or manners
i was doin this shit when you was shittin pampers
i was movin them grams fore you knew what a hand that hand was
duckin the vans radars the scanners
fore you knew what hard white to tame was
i was hittin the turnpike aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cuss aight with them hammers
i was prickin my finger fore you knew what a fam was
i had it laid out fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mill later now you understand us

the past present nigga the future proper
the holy trinity of hiphop is us
we give dre his props but thats where it stops
its the roc
i know you got your eyes on me

but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you bedda off not lookin at all
  
  
  
  
im still on top of the game
still droppin flames still cock and aim
still at the top had the roc for the fame
over setbacks theres been a lot since i came
you seen it all how i got how i gained
the momentum when it dropped how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock they watched me reclaim
the streets they made a special spot for my name
dre haters wanna stop to my reign
but the music lives in me every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the mane
see the world chear for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs itll drive them insane
the eyes that i played
the best to emerge in the game is the watcher
im rated r my brain contains graphics thangs
it turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
its like watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
which means i can see the whole planet in the scene
cash is the topic the object a fatter pocket
some take the crack and chop it but those that havent got it
take away the added profit its catastrophic
i take the gat and cock it and ill sit back and watch it
these new york streets is ugly i keep it gully
the world is mine and cant nobody keep it from me
yo my neighborhood is never sunny
in the place where the number one cause of death is money
you can try copin
ive seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
im still alive and scopin
be another hundred years til my skies close in
and ima die with my eyes open the watcher uhh uhh uhh

mommas youngest and strongest survived summers like saunas
mastered a corner like deion in his uniform
pop hurtin assertive flirted with death
damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
grandmas favorite she could not understand
how theres people in the world who wouldnt want me as a neighbor
has to explain to her you think these folks want me in the penthouse
as a reminder that i make top paper
black entrepeneur nobody did us no favors
nobody gave us shit we made us
the rap pack im sinatra dames sam davis
bigs the smart one on the low like dean martin
we came in this game not beggin niggaz pardon
demandin yall respect hand over a check
and while yall at it hand over the jet
we the reason they aint hand over def jam so quick
they new every year i was droppin new product
i was raisin the stock up while buildin the roc up
but thats alright cause they knew they had to see us
when it was time for us to reup make us multimillionires
jejejeah
jeah  in my lifetime
i caught smaller cases but i had capital
hypocritic system let me right back at you
you better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
not even that scratches you specially if you black dude
they dont give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
and they can look good by paintin him as bad news
cause in my past i seen dudes get half of they views
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
so imagine how disturbed i was
when i seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
let me explain exactly how this shit was
this nigga un yo i scratched him he went home without an aspirin
but its cool cause hes back friends and halfinning is over
its in the past and im glad now im back to bein hova

helicopter seat feat inclined shit feelin like a sofa
helicopter meet me teta vero take me over
somewhere peaceful for the weekend now its back to speakin of vultures
so the next time that page six approaches us
heres a quote from jay nigga i did it my  waycan you hear me now  good

the blueprint birthed nigga i earthed you you cant be serious
young cause im thirtytwo dressed like im twentytwo
flow like a  do what i wanna do
goin on my th ring got phil jacksons and
flow is black magic im at it again
rose bowl with black karats horse  carriage to spend
like mason betha chasin this cheddar to the end
of the road because the end im told is nearer than we know
what can i say but live for today hov
yeah the blueprint  homey follow the moves
you put on two tube socks you couldnt walk in my shoes
i was dealt a bad hand fuck what else could i do
but keep somethin up my sleeve thatll help me through
but can you believe everywhere im at models come through
catfightin catwalkin it happens often
its true how society dont want me to move
into the penthouse building with spectacular views
theyre like uhh hes a menace he could never be a tenant
im like ooh whats a young nigga to do
i bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that i dont
give a fuck we just chillin watchin chandelier ceilings high as fuck
old lady dont blow my high
specially if you dont know my life dont make me bring
sharpton in it cause im darkskinneded or
dude with the fro and the rainbow coalition ima
victim of a single parent household born in a mousehole
mousetrap niggaz wanna know
how so how jay get up out that here yeah
i snatched purses i persevered yeah
i had work fiends purchased it was clear
i was out there sellin hope for despair but stop there
i swear i only make good from my mouth to gods ears
had to get out the hood
and i cant justify genocide
but i was born in the city where the skinny niggaz die
born in the city where the skinny niggaz ride
and as a skinny nigga i had beef with high size 
yeah its magic
uhh jayz and lenny kravitz
and its a heavy d production you bastards
come on
ha hey yo stop playin man
this is real serious
ha  yeah yo
 
lets go
post postatono hov hangin with bono
u can live like salvatore ferragamo
and u can cool out poolside at the delano
and u flow like you was out of your mind yo
cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from mcdonalds
would soon be the boss of the big apple ya know
and who knew dude that played ball for the nba
would make a mistake on the who knew estates throw it away
who knew that would be his last shot who drew up that play
they giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
but even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
you could have turned guns into roses like two times today
now heres something you gotta say two times to jay
i got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
got my boom box suntan lotion waiting for action
they say when you play with skills good luck could happen
lets go
 
 its the roc 
thats right
 
things got too hot so i jumped off in this rap shit
you got it kriskrossed aint no turning me backwards
too many district attorneys concerned with the actions
of one individual hes criminally attached
i turned in all my rap chips im earning my bachelors
while dating all the models and actresses
im learning all the potholes in every single barrio
trying not to mess up my axis kid
on the road to the riches through trafficking
through rappining and whatevers happening
rocawear im the young black ralph lauren
every time i get out they put me right back in
the michael corleone of the microphone
the michelangelo of flow i paint pictures with poems
i gather no moss like a rolling stone
case the grim reaper visits my home nigga im gone cmon
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
tote more guns then roses foes is 
visibly shook of the invisible bully lets go
flowers need water to grow it gotta rain
and in order to experience joy you need pain
every time a baby is born somebodys slain
you know the saying somebodys lose is anothers gain
the sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
a rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
everything evens up you just wait
even a garbage can gets a steak
you aint even a garbage can you have faith
but when it turns your way before it turns away
gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from jay
you will get return in your investment if attention you pay lets go
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
life is all about guns and roses  im not trying to be no big thing no no
you gotta let this one breathe just
just let it breathe for a second
  im not trying to give you no advice
yup hovis home  the newest addition to the roc mop

its the gift  the curse
uhh uhh yea
first they love me then they hate me then they love me again
 they love me again
lets take a trip down i gotcha
lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetary
rain grey skies seems at the end of every
young black life is this line damn  him already
such a good kid got us pourin henn already
liquor to the curb for my niggaz up above
when it cracks through the pavement thats my way of sendin love
so give big a hug tell aaliyah i said hi
til the next time i see her on the other side
he was just some thug that caught some slugs
and we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
he walked like ussss talked like ussss
his back against the wall nigga fought like us  damn
poor isis thats his momma name
momma aint strong enough to raise no boy whats his father name
shorty never knew him though he had his blood in him
hot temper momma said he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with him so the streets raised him
isis blamin herself she wish she coulda saved him
damn near impossible only men can raise men
he was his own man not even him can save him
he put his faith in a thirtyeight in his waist
but when you live by the gun you die by the same fate
end up dead before thirtyeight and umm
thats the life of us raised by winter its a cold world
old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
isis life just ended on that rainy day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed
down at the city morgue opened the drawer saw him nude
her addiction grew prescription drugs shift and brew
angel dust dipped in woo
she slipped into her own fantasy world
had herself pregnant by a different dude
but reality bites and this is her life
he wasnt really her husband though he called her wife
it was just this night when moon was full
and the stars were just right and the dress was real tight
had her soundin like lisa lisa  i wonder if i take you home
will you still love me after this night
mike was the hardhead from the around the way
that she wanted all her life shit she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
he was a willie all her life he wasnt really the one to like
it was a dude named shy who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but isis liked this broadway life
she loved the gucci sneakers the red green and whites
hangin out the window when she first seen him fight
she was so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight that
turned into a homicide thatll alter their life
see mike at thirtytwo was still on the scene
had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
sure he saw him as an infant but he dissed on him like
if that was my son he would look much different
see im lightskinnded and that baby theres dark
so its mommas baby poppas maybe
mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets 
had his old reliable thirtyeight gun in his reach
its been fourteen years him and isis aint speak
he runnin around like lifes a peach til one day
he approached this thug that had a mean mug
and it looked so familiar that he called him young cuz
told him get off the strip but the boy aint budge 
instead he pulled out a newer thirtyeight snub
he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused 
there was somethin in this mans face he knew he seen before
its like lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature
and he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
you know what they say about he who hesitates in war
 he who hesitates is lost
he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank
the old man didnt think he just followed his instinct
six shots into his kid out of the gun

nigga freshdressed and stay poppin tags
put the  on the truck for i drop the rag
bitches want to bring up the topic of my past
its legendary in the hood how i got my cash
im legendady in the hood so i got the mag
and ive never been a fronter so ive got to blast
will i flash not
as im not playing with you motherfuckers the casket drops
you bastards not gon assassinate the name i got
yall hear me though
young hov got the block on smash
and everybody and their momma want to stop my cash
everybody want drama with the top of the brass
til i come through hop out the cab
 they ass
 somebody gon  yall hear me though
young hov got the game in a frenzy
twenty million sold all independently
so when you mention me
make sure you got together your semblies
like hes the games jfkennedy
i started out i aint have no chimney
my ma was santa claus well at least she pretended to be
til one night well thats if memory serves me correct i caught her under
the christmas tree
young hov aint have no pops
thank god man i had the block
yall hear me though
you young fucks got the game all wrong
this is my life man this aint no song
you aint livin your rhymes out you live at your moms house
in that tightass room pullin the cars out
and the mirror pointin at your reflection killing yourself
you american pie stop feeling yourself
nigga you just a worker go deal yourself
stop being a server get a meal yourself
where your heart at all that yickyack aint nobody scared of your gats
we got bigger ones
how many niggas done shot at me shivering
they were so scared they aint hit me once
young hov bout to go to the range
bout to work on perfecting my aimshawn carter was born december th
weighing in at ten pounds eight ounces
he was the last of my four children
the only one who didnt give me any pain when i gave birth to him
and thats how i knew that he was a special child
hi baby whats wrong  you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me is it something that ive done again
 you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me
they say they never really miss you til you dead or you gone
so on that note im leavin after this song
see you aint gotta feel no way about jay so long
at least let me tell you why im this way hold on
i was conceived by gloria carter and adnus reeves
who made love under the sycamore tree
which makes me a more sicker mc and my momma would claim
at ten pounds when i was born i didnt give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare i made up for birth when i got here
she knows my purpose wasnt hurt cause i aint perfect i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasnt matchin my gear
now im just scratchin the surface cause whats buried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
i went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
hold on
shawn was a very shy child growing up
he was into sports and a funny story is
at four he taught himself how to ride a bike
a twowheel at that isnt that special
but i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up
now all the teachers couldnt reach me and my momma couldnt beat me
hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me so
with that disdain in my membrane
got on my pimp game fuck the world my defense came
then dehaven introduced me to the game
spanish jose introduced me to caine im a hustler now
my gear is in and im in the incrowd
and all the wavy lightskinned girls is lovin me now
my selfesteem went through the roof man i got my swag
got a vocal from this girl when her man got bagged
plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had
supposedly  knowin nobody paid jaz whack ass
im gettin ahead of myself by the way i could rap
that came second to me movin this crack
give me a second i swear i would say about my rap career
til ninetysix came niggaz im here  goodbye
  talking
shawn used to be in the kitchen beating on the table and rapping 
and umm into the wee hours of the morning
and then i brought him a boombox
and his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts 
but that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble
goodbye to the game all the spoils the adrenaline rush
your blood boils you in a spot knowin cops could rush
at you in the drop you so easy to touch
no two days are alike except the st and th pretty much
and trust is a word you seldom hear from us
hustlers we dont sleep we rest one eye up
and a drought could define a man when the well dries up
you learn the worth of water
without work you thirst til you die  yup
and niggaz get tied up for product
and little brothers ring fingers get cut up
to show mothers they really got em
and this is the stress i lived with
til i decided to try this rap shit for a livin
i pray im forgiven  for every bad decision i made
every sister i played  cause im still paranoid to this day
and its nobody fault i made the decisions ive made
this is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
now if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black

sponsored by just blaze and the good folks at rocafella records
fellow americans it is with the utmost pride and sincerity
 that i present this recording as a living testiment and recollection
 of history in the making during our generation
allow me to reintroduce myself
my name is hov oh htotheov
i used to move snowflakes by the oz

ceo of the roc hov
fresh out the fryin pan into the fire

with the lexus fastforward the jewels and the necklace
let me tell you dudes what i do to protect this
i shoot at you actors like movie directors 
this aint a movie dog 
now before i finish let me just say
 i did not come here to show out did not come here to impress you
 because to tell you the truth when i leave here im gone
 and i dont care what you think about me  but just remember
 when it hits the fan brother whether its next year ten years 
 twenty years from now youll never be able to say
 that these brothers lied to you jack
ving aint lie
i done came through the block in everything thats fly
im like che guevara with bling on im complex
i never claimed to have wings on
nigga i get mine  by any means on whenever theres a drought
get your umbrellas out because thats when i brainstorm
you can blame shawn but i aint invent the game
i just rolled the dice tryin to get some change
and i do it twice aint no sense in me
lyin as if i am a different man
and i could blame my environment but
there aint no reason why i be buyin expensive chains
hope you dont think users are the only abusers
niggaz gettin high within the game
if you do then how would you explain
im ten years removed still the vibe is in my veins
i got a hustler spirit nigga period
check out my hat yo peep the way i wear it
check out my swag yo i walk like a ballplayer
no matter where you go you are what you are player
and you can try to change but thats just the top layer

to himself or get clapped for whats under that mans belt
i never asked for nothin i dont demand of myself
honesty loyalty friends and then wealth
death before dishonor and i tell you what else
i tighten my belt fore i beg for help
foolish pride is what held me together through the years
i wasnt felt which is why i aint never played myself
i just play the hand im dealt i cant say ive never knelt
before god and asked for better cards at times to no avail
but i never sat back feelin sorry for myself
if you dont give me heaven ill raise hell
til its heaven

and if you feel in my heart that i long for revenge
please blame it on the son of the mornin thanks againyoung  for life
once again its the life yessss
its intoxicatin man yall dont know why you do what you do
the allure of breakin the law
is always too much for me to ever ignore
i gotta thing for them big body benzes it dulls my senses
in love with a vdub engine
man im high off life fuck it im wasted
bathing ape kicks audemar piguet wrists
my women friend get tennis bracelets
trips to venice get they winters replaced with
the sun it aint even fun no more im jaded
man its just a game i just play it to play it
i put my feet in the footprints left to me
without sayin a word the ghettos got a mental telepathy
man my brother hustled so naturally
up next is me but what perplexes me
shit i know how this movie ends still i play
the starrin role in hovitos way
its just life i solemnly swear
to change my approach stop shavin coke
stay away from hoes put down the toast
cause i be doin the most oh no
but every time i felt that was that it called me right back
it called me right back man it called me right back  oh no
im like a russian mobster drinkin distilled vodka
til im under the field with hoffa its real
peel the top up like a toupee
mix the water with the soda
turn the pot up make a souflee
all of yall can get it like groupays in your way
im livin proof that crime do pay
say hooray to the bad guy and all the broads
puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game
puttin caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
all in the name of love
just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
over the house to take back everything that they claimed
or even the worst pain is the distress
learnin youre the mistress only after that love gets slain
and the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
now it gets tough to ever love again
but the allure of the game keeps callin your name
to all the allurists of the world i feel your pain
to all the christies in every cities and tiffany lanes
we all hustlers in love with the same thang
i never felt more alive than ridin shotgun
in clines green  until the cops pulled guns
and i tried to smoke weed to give me the fix i need
what the game did to my pulse with no results
and you can treat your nose and still wont come close
the game is a lightbulb with eleventymillion volts
and im just a moth addicted to the floss
and doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
by any means necessary whatever the cost
even if it means lives is lost
and i cant explain why i just love to get high
drink life smoke the blueberry sky blink twice
im in the blueberry  you blink three times
i may not even be alive
i mean james dean couldnt escape the allure
dyin young leavin a good lookin corpse
of course
once again its the life
i said its the life
once again its the life  oh no
 why i 
get so  uhhuh
hahahahahahaha  wooim just tryin to stay above water yknow
just stay busy stay workin
puff told me like the key to this joint
the key to staying on top of things
is treat everything like its your first project knahmsayin
like its your first day like back when you was an intern
like thats how you try to treat things like just stay hungry
uhh uhh yes yes
yall wanna know why he dont stop
yall wanna know why he dont flop
let me tell you peeople why
came from the bottom of the block i
when i was born it was sworn i was never gon be shit
had to pull the opposite out this bitch
had to get my riide on
eyes on the prize shawn knew i had to
had to had to get these chips
had to make moves like olajuwon
started out sellin dimes and nicks
graduated to a brick
no exaggeration my infatuation with the strip
legendary like a schoolboy
crushin merely nearly every every chick
heavy shit  thats how schoolboy got whipped
and got left on some just me myself and i
on some trugoy shit
had your boys threw place up to a place of no return
had to play with fire and get burned
only way the boy ever gon learn
had to lay way in the cut til i finally got my turn
now im on top in the spot that i earned
its my life  its my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
its my everything
like i never rode in a limo
like i just dropped flows to a demo
like its ninetytwo again and
and i got os in the rental
back in the stu again no prob livin was a whole lot simpler
when you think back you thought that
you would never make it this far then you
take advantage of the luck you handed
or the talent you been given
aint no half steppin aint no no slippin
aint no different from a block thats hidden
gotta get it while the gettings good
gotta strike while the irons hot fore you stop
then you gotta bid it good riddance
goodbye this is my second major breakup
my first was with a pager
with a hooptie a cookpot and the caine
this ones with the stool with the stage with the fortune
maybe not the fortune but certainly the fame
its my life  my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me
its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst like the first song i sang
woo its like the blues  we gon ride out on this one

whatever guillotine guides my life
dear lord dont let me die tonight
but if i shall before i wake what shall i say

even though i dont act like it
even though i hear my calling and fight it
fools do me so wrong its hard to stay righteous
if pimping was a mountain to heaven id hike it

sometimes i dont like who i am
when i look in the mirror my reflection is uncle sam
and every night i have these weird dreams

but if i shall before i wake id accept my fate
i did what i did my heart was in the right place
i did so i could live to put food on my plate
you musta loved me not to let it end by  that day
well whatever the case im glad it wasnt murder
in a town you never hearda from a nickelplated burner

all we wanna see is them hands up hands up
this is for them hustlin boys and girls
its the return of best of both worlds
well once upon a time they left the glove and the star kid
he swore he was the man but he was nothing but garbage
let me rephrase that bubblin with pride
did have skills but he was ugly inside
instead of uplift folks sittin on the non sense
hurtin people feelings like he didnt have a conscience
like i love you when hes hittin that stash
then degraded the shorty like he didnt have class
even let a gay jew man tack his jheri
then got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy
swindlin forgot the god above him
finally fan base trinklin down to nothing
no concern for his estate though was yearnin for a break
bitter and evil didnt learn from his mistake
the moral of the story is dont be a pair of knickers
be good boys and girls and you can be as great as
rick is
my baby mommas robe my rent is overdue
it took half the pay and now my life is filled with rainy days
but i stashed some dough how much youll ever know

shoulda stayed in food and beverage
too much flossing
too much sam rothstein
i aint a bitch but i gotta divorce them
hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
and i aint even want to be famous
niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
and i aint even know how it came to this
except that fame is
the worst drug known to man
its stronger than heroin
when you could look in the mirror like there i am
and still not see what youve become
i know im guilty of it too but not like them
you lost one
lose one let go to get one
left one lose some to win some 
sorry im a champion sorry im a champion
you lost one
i dont think its meant to be be
but she loves her work more than she does me
and honestly at twentythree
i would probably love my work more than i did she
so we aint we
its me and her
cause what she prefers over me is work
and thats where we differ
so i have to give her
free time even if it hurts
so breathe mami its deserved
youve been put on this earth to be
all you can be like the reserves
and me my time in the army its served
so i have to allow she her time to serve
the times now for her
in time shell mature
and maybe we can be we again like we were
finally my times too short to share
and to ask her now it aint fair

lose one let go to get one
left one lose some to win some 
sorry im a champion sorry im a champion

life is but a dream to me
i dont wanna wake up
thirty odd years without having my cake up
so im about my paper
  in a leap year
i dont know why we here
since we gotta be here
life is but a beach chair
went from having shabby clothes
crossing over abbey roads
hear my angels singing to me
are you happy hov
i just hope im hearing right
karmas got me feearing life
colleek are you praying for me
i got deamons in my past
so i got daughters on the way
if the prophecys correct
then the child should have to pay
for the since of a father
so i barter my tommorows
against my yesterdays
in hopes that shell be ok
and when im no longere here
the shade of face from the flare
ill give her my share of carols daughter
and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave 
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave
life is but a dream to me
gun shots sing to these
other guys but lullabys
dont mean a ting to me
im not afraid of dyng
im afraid of not trying
everyday hit every wave
like im hawaiian
i dont surf the net
no i never been on myspace
too busy letting my voice vibrate
carving out my space
in this world of fly girls
cutthroats   diamond cut ropes i twirls
benzs round corners
where the sun dont shine
i let the wheels give a glimpse
of hope of ones grind
some said hov how you get so fly
i said from not being afraid to fall out the sky
my physicals shell
so when i say farewell
my soul will find an even
higher plane to dwell
so fly you shall
so have no fear just know that
life is but a beach chair
life is but a dream cant mimic my life
im the thinnest cut slice
intercut the winners cup
with winters rough enough
to interrupt life
thats why im both
the saint  the sinner
nice
this is jay everyday
no compromise
no compass comes with this life
just eyes
so to map it out
you must look inside
sure books can guid you
but your heart defines you
chica
you corason is what brought us home
in great shape like heidi klum
maricon i am on
permanent vaca
life is but a beach chair
this song is like a hallmark card
until you read each here
so till shes here
and she declaired
the aire
i will be prepared
a blueprint for you to print
a map so you can back
a guide for your eyes
and so you wont lose scent
ill make a stink for you to think
i ink these verses full of prose
so you wont get connect out of  cent
my last will and testament i leave my heir
my share of rocafella records and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing deliver me from my enemies oh god
defend me from all that rise up against me
deliver me from the work of inequity
and save me from the bloody mary
look mind state of a gangster from the s
meets the business mind of motowns berry gordy
turned crack rock into a chain of s
sorry my jewelry is so gaudy
slid into the party with my new pair of mauris
america meet the gangster shawn corey
hey young world wanna hear a story
close your eyes and you can pretend youre me
im cut from the cloth of the kennedys
frank sinatra havin dinner with the genovese
this is the genesis of a nemesis
mother americas not witnessed since
the harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
this is the tale of lost innocence
as the incense burns and the turntables turn
and that al green plays
i see my mothers afro
as mama taps her toes as she rolls her js
and my papa just left the house
in search of the killer of my uncle ray
and shes trying to calm her nerves
as i observe this is just one day
and what tomorrow has in store
we can never be sure so all we can do is pray
because of your strength
while i walk the pond of eden
for god is my deep fix 
as i head to my homeroom
i observe the ruins
dope needles on the ground
i hear a car go vroom
drug dealer in the bm with the top down
as the girls start to giggle
i ask why you laugh
they say youre too little
one day youll understand
when you become a man
bout things you have to get you
fast forward freeze frame on my pistol fistful of dollars
ignorance is so blissful
i aint choose this life this life chose me
around here its the shit that you just do
i just left school
the same bm is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
they had their guns drawn
screaming just move
or is there something else you suggest we can do
he made his way to the trunk
opened it like huh
a treasure chest was removed
cops said hell be back next month
what we called corrupt he calls payin dues
now when the rules is blurred
as they is and were
what am i to do but pray
pray the lord forgive me
pray he guides me by for what im bout to go through pray
 
deliver me in thy righteousness
and cause me to escape
and climb thine air internal
save me thine lord 
geah anywhere theres oppression
the drug profession
flourishes like beverages
refreshing ahhh sweet taste of sin
everything i seen made me everything i am
bad drug dealer or victim i beg
what came first 
moving chickens or the egg
this i why i be so fresh
im trying to beat life cause i cant cheat death
treat shame with shamelessness
and stainless at anuses
you know the game this is
move coke like pepsi
dont matter what the brand name is
i stand behind mine
everything i do im a man behind mine
im not an angel im sure
but every night before i lay
i drop my knees to the floor and i pray
the name shall endure forever
the name shall be continued as long as the sun 
men shall be blessed in him
all nations shall call him blessed
in your name i pray 
lord bless usdreamed of you this morning
then came the dawn and
i thought you were here with me

dreams seem dumb they said wise up

through the mystery we get it swiftly 
we got to hit you every night before we hit the lights its type addictive
need cats to live with the heat goes on
everyday is a hustle the beat goes on
funny thing happen in the midst of chasing money and foes
and the worst thing worst then getting old is not getting old
niggaz stay low like six bowls of shit and gold 
and watch the hoes when they bump into your clothes
and i hope they shine
seen a lot of things and enough memories to last me two lifetimes
cant knock the hustle

when i get home
then its on
girl just crack those shaped legs like grade a eggs
love the way you behave and beg
moan turn those hollers to screams as we zone like a college team
then they can hear you from hollis queens 
life with me consists of a lot of things
chips in your ear hit the dirt cause you got hotter things
but you know how to scream friends talking dizziness
remind them freak chicks to stay out my business
you know they cant love it trips to la with no luggage
came back with six bags struggling
in first class if my ass should crash champagne spilled on me
bank still off on me
chorus  
but until the last day im the one whos crazy
cause thats the way you making me feel 
i dont want no romance i just want the chance
cant knock the hustle for real
verse three
ever since you retired working alongside those live wires
been in this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars
i guess im biased what i talk about i live
these rap dudes can flip but some of them aint even rhyming for chips
what part of the game is this
seems brainless on tours with whores thats what im saying i miss

but i know just what it feels like
to have a voice in the back of my head
its like a face that i hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time they lie
a face that laughs every time they fall
so you know that when its time to sink or swim
that the face inside is hearing me
right underneath my skin

from record sales to sold out concerts
so muh if you want this encore
i need you to scream til your lungs get sore
tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
and every second i waste is more than i can taaaakkee
ive become so numb
i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
ive become so nuuuuummmbbb

the clock ticks life away and 
i didnt look out below
i watch the time go right out the window
trying to hold on and didnt even know
i wasted it all just to

take this ride make you feel it inside your belly
if its tight get the ky jelly

side to side til you say jayz youre too much for me
i am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints but i cant help the fact
that everybody can see these scars

to just believe this is real
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do

now shes mad at me causer your majesty just happened to be
a pimp what a tragedy
she wanted us to end cause i fucked with friends
she gave me one more chance and i fucked her again
i seen her tears as she busted in i said shit
theres a draft shut the door bitch and come on in
i am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
cuz you dont understand i do what i can
sometimes i dont make sense
i am what you never wanna say but ive never had a doubt
its like no matter what i do i cant convince you for once just to hear me out
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do

if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
got em mike
hes got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure his caskets closed
rap critics that say hes money cash hoes
hes from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
if you grew up with holes in your zapatoes
youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
so fuck critics you can kiss the whole asshole
if you dont like the lyrics you can press fast forward
got beef with radio if we dont play they show
they dont play our hits  we dont give a shit so
all these mags try and use our ass
so advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
i dont know what you take us as
or understand the intelligence that jayz has
from rags to riches we aint dumb
we got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
 problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now the year is ninetyfour in my trunk is raw
in the rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
i got two choices yall pull over the car or 
bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor 
and i aint tryin to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
so i pull over to the side of the road i heard
  
cause im young and im black and my hats real low
or do i look like a mindreader sir  i dont know
am i under arrest or should i guess some mo
  well you was doin fiftyfive in the fiftyfour
  license and registration and step out of the car 
  are you carryin a weapon on you  i know a lot of you are
i aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
  
well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
  arent you sharp as a tack  you some type of
  lawyer or somethin somebody important or somethin
ha i aint passed the bar but i know a little bit
enough that you wont illegally search my shit
  
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
this is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
but a pussy havin no god damn sense try an push me
i try to ignore him talk to the lord
pray for him but some fools just love to perform
you know the type loud as a motorbike
but wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing thats gon happen is ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
and there i go trapped in the kitkat again
back through the system with the riffraff again
fiends on the floor scratchin again
paparazzis with they cameras snappin them
da try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mill for bail cause im african
all because this fool was harassin them
tryin to play the boy like hes saccharin
but aint nuttin sweet bout how i hold my gun
i got  problems b and a bitch aint one  hit me
shut up when im talkin to you

never crossed the black cat with the riches
im leaving stevie sayin no wonder youre superstitious
beef im with it simple yall can all get it

i bubble like lather hustle like the leadoff batter
cause all that matters is the money til it aint funny
you feel me when the beast screams kill me
dont jerk me boy i rip it silly
ill let you rise of course but if you dont fall off on your own
emcees i cut off at the knees like shorts
it gets worst if you dont care for my sick thoughts like a nurse
with no known remedy im leaving boys and men on bended knee till the end of the road
i lie low forget this record shit with one sale
check it out
the nerve of these herbs
yall know which swerve from the curb in the lax
the best observe
im splashing splurging dashing thats my word ya know
champagne glass is crashing cant ration
used to having a whole lot so dough i blow a lot

like the point guard off your favorite team without doubt
my life aint rosy but i roll with it
my mind was fine until the dough hit it and told me that the mo did it
and now its kosher shit is so hasidic

tryin to strike a bargain hoping that they might get pardoned

and my cerebral bes the wickedess evil thoughts that this martyr feed you
feedback in the game so deep fiends could catch ya

history so long so long 
 so long so long
so now im flirting with death 
hustling like a g while victory wasnt watching took chances repeatedly
as a teenage boy before acne before i got proactive i couldnt face she
i just threw on my hoody and headed to the street
i swear i met success we lived together shortly
now success was like lust shes good to the touch
shes good for the moment but shes never enough
everybodys had her shes nothing like v
but success is all i got unfortunately
but im burning down the block hoping in and out of v
but something tells me there is much more to see
before i get killed cause i cant get robbed
so before me success and death ménage
i gotta get lost i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battle finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long
so long so long
now victory is mine taste so sweet
shes my trophy wife your coming with me
well have a baby who stutters repeatedly
well name him history hell repeat after me
hes my legacy son of my hard work
future of my past thatll explain who ill be
rank me amongst the greats either one two or three
if i aint number one then ive failed you victory
aint in it for the fame that dies within weeks
aint in it for the money can take it when you leave
i want to be remembered long after you breathe
long after im gone long after i breathe
i leave all i am in the hands of history
thats my last will testimony
this is much more than a song its a baby shower 
ive been waiting for this hour history of ours
now that all the smoke is gone
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours
history so long so long
so long so longwhen the sky falls and the earth quakes
we gon put this back together
we wont break
sa pa sé my portauprinces
my haitian gods and all of my princesses
our condolences as you fightin against this
were right by your side as we tryin to make sense of this
heavenly father help us see through these problems
and for those that left accept them into your garden
so heres my theory the countrys already starvin
so we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
god please pardon i speak from the heart
its the only way i see this tragedy befall on them
so lets get involved with them hand to hand with them
arm to arm with them til they get strong again
when the sky falls
cant wait until tomorrow
haiti mon amour
haiti mon amour
not gonna leave you stranded alone alone
oh no
learn from the past new orleans was flooded
so we know we just cant rely on the government
we under the rubble again here we go rumbling when
when we gon catch a break my friend lost his mother and then
and then carline lost her uncles and them
buried with no caskets they just put covers on them
and the tears fall and we fight back
story aint done it cant end like that
nah not like this tomorrows survivors gonna carry on your name
you live on inside us your memorys alive with us
you inspired us to rebuild this country you just guide us
its not the angels that are on their way
its not the bells of santa trinite
the people waiting positions vacant
for hands to help not just to pray
haïti va sélever
tu vas te relever
nous nous éléverons
ensemble ensemble ensemble
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break send corrections to the typist

but these mills well they make me hot  yall dont feel me
enough to stop the illin right
but at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
im so confused okay im gettin weeded now
i know i contradicted myself look i dont need that now 
its just once in a blue and its nothin to do and
the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through

i freed my mind sometimes i here myself moanin
take one more toke then i leave that weed alone man
it got me goin shit
  repeat xthis shit is wicked on these mean streets
none of my friends speak
were all trying to win but then again
maybe its for the best though cause when theyre seeing too much
you know theyre trying to get you touched
whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldnt understand the mechanics
and the workings of the underworld granted
nine to five is how to survive i aint trying to survive
im trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
life ills poison my body
i used to say fuck mic skills
and never prayed to god i prayed to gotti
thats right its wicked thats life i live it
aint asking for forgiveness for my sins ends
i break bread with the late heads picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the gamell do
it gets dangerous money and power is changing us
and now were lethal infected with devils
we used to fight for building blocks
now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
the closest of friends when we first started
but grew apart as the money grew and soon grew blackhearted
thinkin back when we first learned to use rubbers
he never learned so in turn im kidnappin his babys mother
my hand around her collar feeding her cheese
she said the taste of dollars was shitty so i fed her fifties
about his whereabouts i wasnt convinced
so i kept feedin her money til her shit started to make sense
who could ever foresee we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
now im tryin to rock this bitch to sleep
all the years we were real close
now i see his fears through her tears
know shes wishin we were still close
dont cry it is to be
in time ill take away your miseries and make em mine devils
my flesh no nigga could test
my soul is possessed by devils in the form of diamonds and lexuses
the exorcist got me doing skits like homie
you dont know me but the whole world owe me  strip
was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
so now im down for whatever aint nothing nice
throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
but now this higher learning got the remy in me
liquors invaded my kidneys
got me ready to lick off mama forgive me
i cant be held accountable devils beatin me down boo
got me runnin with guys making gs tellin lies that sound true
come test me i never cower
for the love of money son im giving lead showers

look if i shoot you im brainless
but if you shoot me then youre famous  whats a ngga to do
when the streets is watching blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it thats the fastest way to get extorted
but my time is money at twentyfive i cant afford it
beef is sorted like godiva chocolates
nggaz you bought it i pull the slide back and cock it
plan aborted you and your mans get a pass
this rhyme youre operating on fck time
yall nggaz aint worth my shells all yall nggaz
tryin to do is hurt my sales and stop trips to john mcnale
the type to start a beef then run to the cops
when i see you in the street got one in the drop
when id rather be on tour gettin a hundred a pop
taking pictures with some btches in front of the drop
the streets is watching
when the streets is watching
blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it
now its hard not to kill nggaz
its like a full time job not to kill nggaz cant chill
the streets is watchin when you froze your arms
nggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm
cant get caught with your feet up gotta keep your heat up
sweet nggaz running round swearing sht is sweeter
once youre tagged lame the game is follow the leader
everybody want a piece of your scrilla so you gotta keep it realer
kidnap nggaz wanna steal ya
broke nggaz want no cash they just wanna kill ya
for the name nggaz dont know the rules
disrespectin the game want you to blow your cool
force your hand of course that mans plottin
smarten up the streets is watchin its on
my street mentality flip bricks forever know me and money
we like armed codefendants ngga we stick together
sht whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
hustle harder to see it if indictment time came around
and you can look up and down the streets and i cant be found
put in twentyfour hour shifts but that aint me now
got a face too easy to trace nggaz mouths got slow leaks
had to hide between my workers couldnt play those streets
she out of space like mercury you jerkin me  hectic
had to call upon my wolves to send nggaz the message
i said this lets play fair and we can stay here
im trying to transform you boyz ii men like daycare
hey theres money to be made and nggaz got the picture
stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
then hard times fell upon us half of my staff
had warrants the other half in the casket lay dormant
i felt like life was cheating me for the first time
in my life i was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me
was this a lesson god teaching me  was he saying that
im playing the game straight from hell from which few came back
like bad coke pimp or die was my mindframe bad
was nggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack
aint a whole lot of brain to that just trying to maintain a stack
and not collide like two trains thats on the same track         
but get my life together like the oars i bring back
in the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
got my transporter take it cross the border then stop
to set up shop with a quarter of rock  heres the plan
for three straight weeks nggaz slaughtered the block
but you know the game is lluted fcked up me and my dues
one drop can wipe a ngga out faster than the cops
and this unstable way of living just had to stop
half of my nggaz got time we done real things
by ninetyfour became the subject of half of yall nggaz rhymes
public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street
but thats the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets
the life and times of a demonic mind excited with crime
and the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
i figured sht why risk myself i just write it in rhymes
and let you feel me and if you dont like it then fine
the mindstate of a ngga who boosted the crime rate
so high in one city they send national guards to get me
ya dig
the streetsverse one
im done talking
ran up in the spot gun smoking
shot it in the air one woke him
sunsoaking sweating in his bed like dunlo
thinking to himself what done provoked him
his thoughts is racing like a vulcan
i swear i saw a lightbulb when
he finally figured out who was the culprit
i said yeah remember me from friend or foe when
i told you dont ever ever come around here no more
time to pay now you try to rise i wave the gun  lay down
this time youre really going to listen to jay now
i try to talk sensibly hoping that eventually you realize
i had this locked and it just wasnt meant to be
plus i had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
and it wasnt afterthought that maybe youll try to revenge me
but i was like nah chromes had to know he was wrong
and if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
plus you promised
and thats really no fun 
yeah i find you in this motel  with all these guns
and all your goons lined up in adjoining rooms
like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
but my minds like a flower in bloom
 my eyes just scower the room
im alert plus i paid the clerk i got it laid out
you think you the first nigga i played out in a  hotel town 
come on now i peep your lexus at you
left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
money well invested rudely interrupted
jamaican accents  
a gun in your face and thats all you can come up with
im done talking back up and clap them one in the abdomen 
do me a favor dude get  ice cubes i pass them
take that ice up for the nicest mc
and please yo tell big hes unbelievable 
friend or foe biotchhow can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in
theres gotta be them times youll be wrong nah mean
how can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga 
he never even met that he dont even know and shit
i think this rap shit is all beef
yall dont even know every day im livin with stress
got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
cant even enjoy myself at a party unless
im on the dance floor hot ass vest
you think im freakin these chicks right
itry not to brush against they chest

swear to everything when i leave this earth
its gon be on both feet never knees in the dirt
you could try me fucka but when i squeeze it hurts fine
well lose two lives yours and mines
gimme any amount of time dont let ms carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin tears on my sleeve
told the judge didnt budge it was him or me
and i aint trying to be hard but im guilty as charged
put my mercy on this court and my faith in god 
and pray hard none of my nephews wanna be starslucky me
chorus karen anderson
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
i hate all girls with alterior motives
thats why im twenty plus years old no sons no daughters
hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
hear the hate in my voice right i hate that you noticed
niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
hate a nigga like that faggot get your own
hate that i cant roam the street without the clip and chrome
knowing one day ima have to flip cmon
you know the shit dont stop til the crist dont pop
and you have to kill a nigga and your wrist dont lock
im trapped the whole worlds against me in fact

hate the price of fame cause it cost too much

hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
steady looking for flaws through us lucky me
chorus karen anderson jayz
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me 
and now that ive arrived
i see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold
nigga see you in the street pretend to be friendly
but i know any type of success breeds envy
i know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me
leave my friends in a circle pouring out henny
but gs is heaven bound so how im gon receive 
anything yall pour to the ground next time throw it up
and aint nothing changed so even in my afterlife i show it up
dont grieve for me my art remains
like a dart from the speaker to your heart
spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal
plan to leave without a fight i plant a seed i give life
though i cant see past the girls greed to call her wife
next time your thinking heist better be precise
cause im fully prepared one of us is gon leave here

just a breeze not enough to catch a real vibe
then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five

cuts and scratchesuhhuh jeje jejejeah 
yeyeyeah yeyeyeah
how real is this how real is this
uhhuh huh inspect this here check
verse one
im from where the hammers rung news cameras never come
you and your man houndin every verse in your rhyme
where the grams is slung niggas vanish every summer
where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can and run
where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
to achieve this goal quicker sold all my weight wet
faced with immeasurable odds still i get straight bets
so i felt some more something and you nothing check
i from the other side with other guys dont walk to much
and girls in the projects wouldnt fuck us if we talked too much
so they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
i dont know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us
im from where the beef is inevitable summertimes unforgetable
boosters in abundance buy a halfprice sweater new
your world was everything so everything you said youd do
you did it couldnt talk about it if you aint lived it
i from where niggas pull your car and argue all day about
whos the best mcs biggie jayz and nas
where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
at each others throats for the love of foreign cars
where cats catch cases hoping the judge r and rs
but most times find themselves locked up behind bars
im from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
im from marcy son just thought id remind yall
chorus 
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
mentally been many places but im brooklyns own
verse two
im from the place where the chruch is the flakiest
and niggas is praying to god so long that they atheist
where you cant put your vest away and say youll wear it tomorrow
cause the day after well be saying damn i was just with him yesterday
im a block away from hell not enough shots away from straight shells
an ounce away from a triple beam still using a handheld weight scale
your laughing you know the place well
where the liqour stores and the base well
and government fuck government niggas polotic themselves
where we call the cops the ateam
cause they hop out of vans and spray things
and life expectancy so low we making out wills at eightteen
where how you get rid of guys who step out of line your rep solidifies
so tell me when i rap you think i give a fuck who criticize
if the shit is lies god strike me
and i got a question are you forgiving guys who live just like me
well never know
one day i pray to you and said if i ever blow let em know
mistakes aint exactly what takes place in the ghetto
promise fulfilled but still i feel my job aint done
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
chorus 
verse three
im from where they crossover and clap boards
lost jehovah in place of rap lords listen
im up the block round the corner and down the street
from where the pimps prostitutes and the drug lords meet
we make a million off of beats cause our stories is deep
and fuck tomorrow as long as the night before was sweet
niggas get lost for weeks in the streets twisted off weed
and no matter the weather niggas know how to draw heat
whether your fourfeet or minute size it always starts out with
three dice and shoot the five
niggas thought they douce was live now hit em with trips
and i reached down for their money pa forget about this
this time around its platinum like the shit on my wrist
and this glock on my waist yall cant do shit about this
niggas will show you love thats how they fool thugs
before you know it your lying in a pool of blood
chorus kelly price 
talking throughout my life 
no matter what ive done
youve been merciful and your love endureth 
through all things  for that
i am eternally grateful
verse 
since my date of birth
bought you nothing but hurt
play those video games
stole change from ya purse
sat on the cold court bench
til i was arraigned in ya skirt
saw the pain in ya face
through you maintained a smirk
all you did was motivate me
dont let em hold you back
what i do i turned around
and i sold you crack
i was a bastard for that
still im drowning in shame
just remember one thing now
youre not to blame
you was newly seperated
tryin to escape ya world
and through my thirst
i didnt help you
i just made things worse
i hated me and everybody
that created crack
had me thinkin
the newest kicks and the latest gat
still havent apologized
so please play this back
while i try to come to terms
with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way
cocaine numbs the brain
all i did was think about
how the funds once came
then i ran across this memory 
and it stung the brain
how can you ever destroy the beauty
from which one came
thats a savage youre the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why i rhyme above average and
i aint shit
glad you got yourself together
no thanks to me
strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
you must love me
chorus  
say that you love me
all i know say that you must love me
ohh yeah
verse 
we used to fight every night
but i never would suffer
just smile my big brothers
tryna make me tougher
as we grew fussing and fighting continued
as i plundered through ya stuff
and snuck ya clothes to school
got intense real intense
as we got older
never believed it would lead
to be popped in one of ya shoulda
with my rings knew you had it
cause you took too long
as mickey andy and the girl that bought it looked on
huffin and puffin gun in my hand
told you step outside
hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
made our way down the steps
maybe you thought it was just a threat
or maybe ya life was just that crazy
and you was beggin for death
try to justify this in my young mind
but ya drillin it
and my ego hurt combined
drove me berzerk
saw the devil in your eyes
high off more than weed
confused i just closed
my young eyes and squeezed sorry boys
but all the money in the world couldnt bring me back again
lay down lay down
gonna stretch my mic out in ponce funeral home on marcy
all those new niggaz stop there
but a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
the last of the real hustlers well
maybe not the last
bleeks gonna be a good rapper
new improved jayz

im retirin
aint enough money in this game to keep me around

inspect the game yo thats right
 last week i had everything
 i had the money had the cars the bitches
 and the jewelry
	and then my motherfuckin niggaz started snitchin
 beyotch
growin up in the hood just my dog and me
we used to hustle in the hood for all to see
problems i called on him he called on me
we wasnt quite partners i hit him off my p
met him unlocked doors off my keys
yeah we spoke much more than cordially
man he broke bread with me my business spread swiftly
the feds came to get me we both fled quickly
wasnt quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
got caught and thats when our relationship strayed
used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
and when he called collect and i heard his name
i quickly accepted but when i reached the phone
hes talkin reckless i can sense deceit in his tone
i said damn dawg what nine weeks and youre home
he said main man you think shits sweet cause youre home
i just sat spat no more speech in the phone
the crackers up there bleachin your dome youre reachin
i said the world dont stop ive got to keep keep on
from there i sensed the beef was on
i ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
to see if i had bugs and leeches on my phone
cant be too safe cause niggaz is twofaced
and they show the other side when they catch a new case
its on
it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i dont see how this side of you could be provoked
funny what seven days can change
a stand up nigga now you sit down to aim
used to have a firm grip now you droppin names
uhhuh uhhuh 
like i put the toast to your head and made you sell
we both came in this game blind as hell
i did a little better had more clientele
told you put away some cheddar now you cryin for bail
seventeen and im holdin on to around a mill
i could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill
had niggaz thinkin i was from uptown for real
i had so much hustle plus i was down to ill
like a brooklyn nigga straight out of brownsville
down and dirty down to fight the round thirty
freezin on them corners still holdin my crack
lookin up and down the block the fuck is the dough at
came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
you tell them feds i said im never goin back
im from marcy and marcy dont raise no rats
you know the consequences of your acts you cant be serious
the lawyer i retained you said you leakin some things
all this after a week in the bang
im mad at myself cause i didnt spot the weak and lame
i woulda bet the house you wouldnt speak a thang
nigga this was the oath to the top of broke
even pricked our finger anything that got between us
we sposed to cock the ninas what happened to that
instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
fuck it the same thing make you laugh make you cry
thats right the same game that make you mad could make you die
its a dice game and sometimes you crap
who woulda thought youd get popped one time and rap
now you know thats bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up like this is my dad
the labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
youll always be in jail nigga just minus the bars
shit is crazy man
all these niggaz out here snitchin
we was one step away from takin this crack money
and recyclin it through the ghettoes
and buildin back up our own hoods
now all you niggaz start snitchin on each other

i felt his hatred it was harsh fore this fakin shit start
i should take him in back of the building and blaze him
uhoh this nigga jay he aint slow he musta picked up on the vibe
and had i not been so high i woulda been able to hide
tried to cover up myself as i gave him a five
hugged him as if i loved him
to the naked eye
it woulda seemed we was the closest but to those that know us
could see that somethin was about to go down
stay focused
im tryin to concentrate but its like hes reading my mind
as if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
could he see i had plans on bein the man
ever since we first spoke and he put that g in my hand
and i gave it back to show him i was down for the cause
as he approached  and i paused

	im gone 
	the state vs shawn carter aka jayz
	uhh uhhuhuh uhh uhhuhuh uhh
	whatever the verdict in this trial may be
	the effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide

	they call me dope man dope man
	i try to tell em im where hope floats man
	ghetto spokesman
a broke man approachin the bench with intent
to bury me under the cell fingered me as the toast man
evidence stemmin from ninetysix
they say the world aint recovered from his fix
while they was usin cut i was on some other shit
gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
nowaday the jury got they brow raised
listenin to testimony about my foul ways
exhibit a reasonable doubt
they say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
	you can feel the tension building here
	as an unprecedented number of people have turned out
	for what may be the trial of the century
how come you label your brand of dope
volume  and spread it through the slums
fed it to the young with total disregard
your honor the state seeks the maximum charge
and how could you turn right around
and release a lethal dosage called volume 
and is true you operate the criminal enterprise
known as rocafella in charge of his meteoric rise
and do you deny youre responsible for the demise
of record execs and do you object
your distributions polygram and through your connects
def jam you pushed over five million soundscan
and not to mention your cohorts and henchmen
dame biggs lyor kev and russell simmons
and we aint gon talk about murder inc
that just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
	the state is seeking the maximum penalty
	and with the overwhelming amount of evidence
	the das presented things arent looking good
	despite the grim outlook at this point
	the rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
	in the face of adversity
	jayz is taking the stand
right hand on the bible left hand in the air
before i spoke one word made sure my throat was clear
ahem im a prisoner of circumstance
frail nigga i couldnt much work with my hands
but my mind was strong i grew where you hold your blacks up
trap us expect us not to pick gats up
where you drop your cracks off by the mack trucks
destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
keep us spiralin goin backwards
at age nine saw my first hate crime
blindfolded expected to walk a straight line
mind molded taught to love you and hate mine
climbed over it at a early age jay shined
fuck the system at lady justice i blaze nine
your honor i no longer kill my people i raise mine
the soul of mumia in this modern day time
	while the jury is inside deliberating
	outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation
	well the verdict has just been announced not guilty
	it is complete pandemonium out here 
	people are cheering and hugging  there he is
	jayz is exiting the courtroom right now
	there is a swarm of cameras surrounding him 
	and people are just rushing up to him
	lets try and make our way over there jayz jayz

i dodged prison came out unscathed from car collisions
i know i must be part of some mission

i would ask myself while writin raps to myself
but right there under my nose

when you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
you can light up the whole room turning day from night
when the summertime is in and the tops are down
with you around my neck we lock the whole block down 
it took shortsleeves and loungin to understand
the reason they call you ice everybody freeze
aint a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
and that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
the direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
i used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
guess i was jealous that they was so next to you
so i devoted half my time to invest in you
the other half was spent on protecting you
cause you belong to me now sing ya song for me

you find a dude in town you send him a short message
say hey im new in town i dont know my way around

i get that butter all night
cause most niggaz dont know a brick from a bike
they keep buyin hard white
and if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
fyi i never been robbed in my life
or  you find a chick shit you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you round town like her man
shake hands make friends like its all innocent
then  before they look up you sellin the town cookup
or  gorilla pimp come up on that killer shit
take a nigga brick smack him then you sell it back to them

you new in town no red and blue in town theres gangs

uh huhyeah yeahmotherfuckers 
say that im foolish i only talk about jewels 
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothin i made somethin doin
what i do through and through and
i give you the news  with a twist its just his ghetto pointofview
the renegade you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture bring em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no hes not around  now how that sound to ya jot it down
i bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
i help them see they way through it  not you
cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth you lose your tie and your shirt
since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it with em a minute
cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference  theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict  like you didnt experiment
now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin dogooders  too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
 and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go  hes 
and im the sinister mr kissmyass its just the
 renegade  never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a renegade  never been afraid to talk
about anything  anything  renegade
 never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a  never been afraid to holler
about anything  anything 
i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
whatchu hollerin gotta pay rent bring dollars in
by the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
doorag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me  im awkward i box leftier often
my pops left me an orphan my momma wasnt home
could not stress to me i wasnt grown specially on nights
i brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor  thirty years my senior
my childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky
big i did it  multi before i die 
no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight
see im a poet to some a regular modern day shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatterbrained atheist
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter  a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see its easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water  no wonder they try to hold me under longer
im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube  motherfuckers hate to like you

we was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
mommas rent his young brothers clothes
my nephews food and with that i sqooze
 and with that i froze
now my life is frozen in time behind these iron poles
and this story is told for young soldiers

hold back my pride but reality is screamin

okay lets do this 
things just aint the same for gangsters
but im a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
all of these rap singers claimin they bangers
doin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin the game no home trainin or manners
i was doin this shit when you was shittin pampers
i was movin them grams fore you knew what a hand that hand was
duckin the vans radars the scanners
fore you knew what hard white to tame was
i was hittin the turnpike aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cuss aight with them hammers
i was prickin my finger fore you knew what a fam was
i had it laid out fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mill later now you understand us

the past present nigga the future proper
the holy trinity of hiphop is us
we give dre his props but thats where it stops
its the roc
i know you got your eyes on me

but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you bedda off not lookin at all
  
  
  
  
im still on top of the game
still droppin flames still cock and aim
still at the top had the roc for the fame
over setbacks theres been a lot since i came
you seen it all how i got how i gained
the momentum when it dropped how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock they watched me reclaim
the streets they made a special spot for my name
dre haters wanna stop to my reign
but the music lives in me every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the mane
see the world chear for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs itll drive them insane
the eyes that i played
the best to emerge in the game is the watcher
im rated r my brain contains graphics thangs
it turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
its like watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
which means i can see the whole planet in the scene
cash is the topic the object a fatter pocket
some take the crack and chop it but those that havent got it
take away the added profit its catastrophic
i take the gat and cock it and ill sit back and watch it
these new york streets is ugly i keep it gully
the world is mine and cant nobody keep it from me
yo my neighborhood is never sunny
in the place where the number one cause of death is money
you can try copin
ive seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
im still alive and scopin
be another hundred years til my skies close in
and ima die with my eyes open the watcher uhh uhh uhh

pop hurtin assertive flirted with death
damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
grandmas favorite she could not understand
how theres people in the world who wouldnt want me as a neighbor
has to explain to her you think these folks want me in the penthouse
as a reminder that i make top paper
black entrepeneur nobody did us no favors
nobody gave us shit we made us
the rap pack im sinatra dames sam davis
bigs the smart one on the low like dean martin
we came in this game not beggin niggaz pardon
demandin yall respect hand over a check
and while yall at it hand over the jet
we the reason they aint hand over def jam so quick
they new every year i was droppin new product
i was raisin the stock up while buildin the roc up
but thats alright cause they knew they had to see us
when it was time for us to reup make us multimillionires
jejejeah
jeah  in my lifetime
i caught smaller cases but i had capital
hypocritic system let me right back at you
you better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
not even that scratches you specially if you black dude
they dont give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
and they can look good by paintin him as bad news
cause in my past i seen dudes get half of they views
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
so imagine how disturbed i was
when i seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
let me explain exactly how this shit was
this nigga un yo i scratched him he went home without an aspirin
but its cool cause hes back friends and halfinning is over
its in the past and im glad now im back to bein hova

helicopter seat feat inclined shit feelin like a sofa
helicopter meet me teta vero take me over
somewhere peaceful for the weekend now its back to speakin of vultures
so the next time that page six approaches us
heres a quote from jay nigga i did it my  waycan you hear me now  good

flow like a  do what i wanna do
goin on my th ring got phil jacksons and
flow is black magic im at it again
rose bowl with black karats horse  carriage to spend
like mason betha chasin this cheddar to the end
of the road because the end im told is nearer than we know
what can i say but live for today hov
yeah the blueprint  homey follow the moves
you put on two tube socks you couldnt walk in my shoes
i was dealt a bad hand fuck what else could i do
but keep somethin up my sleeve thatll help me through
but can you believe everywhere im at models come through
catfightin catwalkin it happens often
its true how society dont want me to move
into the penthouse building with spectacular views
theyre like uhh hes a menace he could never be a tenant
im like ooh whats a young nigga to do
i bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that i dont
give a fuck we just chillin watchin chandelier ceilings high as fuck
old lady dont blow my high
specially if you dont know my life dont make me bring
sharpton in it cause im darkskinneded or
dude with the fro and the rainbow coalition ima
victim of a single parent household born in a mousehole
mousetrap niggaz wanna know
how so how jay get up out that here yeah
i snatched purses i persevered yeah
i had work fiends purchased it was clear
i was out there sellin hope for despair but stop there
i swear i only make good from my mouth to gods ears
had to get out the hood
and i cant justify genocide
but i was born in the city where the skinny niggaz die
born in the city where the skinny niggaz ride
and as a skinny nigga i had beef with high size 
yeah its magic
uhh jayz and lenny kravitz
and its a heavy d production you bastards
come on
ha hey yo stop playin man
this is real serious
ha  yeah yo
 
lets go
post postatono hov hangin with bono
u can live like salvatore ferragamo
and u can cool out poolside at the delano
and u flow like you was out of your mind yo
cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from mcdonalds
would soon be the boss of the big apple ya know
and who knew dude that played ball for the nba
would make a mistake on the who knew estates throw it away
who knew that would be his last shot who drew up that play
they giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
but even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
you could have turned guns into roses like two times today
now heres something you gotta say two times to jay
i got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
got my boom box suntan lotion waiting for action
they say when you play with skills good luck could happen
lets go
 
 its the roc 
thats right
 
things got too hot so i jumped off in this rap shit
you got it kriskrossed aint no turning me backwards
too many district attorneys concerned with the actions
of one individual hes criminally attached
i turned in all my rap chips im earning my bachelors
while dating all the models and actresses
im learning all the potholes in every single barrio
trying not to mess up my axis kid
on the road to the riches through trafficking
through rappining and whatevers happening
rocawear im the young black ralph lauren
every time i get out they put me right back in
the michael corleone of the microphone
the michelangelo of flow i paint pictures with poems
i gather no moss like a rolling stone
case the grim reaper visits my home nigga im gone cmon
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
tote more guns then roses foes is 
visibly shook of the invisible bully lets go
flowers need water to grow it gotta rain
and in order to experience joy you need pain
every time a baby is born somebodys slain
you know the saying somebodys lose is anothers gain
the sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
a rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
everything evens up you just wait
even a garbage can gets a steak
you aint even a garbage can you have faith
but when it turns your way before it turns away
gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from jay
you will get return in your investment if attention you pay lets go
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
life is all about guns and roses  im not trying to be no big thing no no
you gotta let this one breathe just
just let it breathe for a second
  im not trying to give you no advice
yup hovis home  the newest addition to the roc mop

its the gift  the curse
uhh uhh yea
first they love me then they hate me then they love me again
 they love me again
lets take a trip down i gotcha
lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetary
rain grey skies seems at the end of every
young black life is this line damn  him already
such a good kid got us pourin henn already
liquor to the curb for my niggaz up above
when it cracks through the pavement thats my way of sendin love
so give big a hug tell aaliyah i said hi
til the next time i see her on the other side
he was just some thug that caught some slugs
and we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
he walked like ussss talked like ussss
his back against the wall nigga fought like us  damn
poor isis thats his momma name
momma aint strong enough to raise no boy whats his father name
shorty never knew him though he had his blood in him
hot temper momma said he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with him so the streets raised him
isis blamin herself she wish she coulda saved him
damn near impossible only men can raise men
he was his own man not even him can save him
he put his faith in a thirtyeight in his waist
but when you live by the gun you die by the same fate
end up dead before thirtyeight and umm
thats the life of us raised by winter its a cold world
old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
isis life just ended on that rainy day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed
down at the city morgue opened the drawer saw him nude
her addiction grew prescription drugs shift and brew
angel dust dipped in woo
she slipped into her own fantasy world
had herself pregnant by a different dude
but reality bites and this is her life
he wasnt really her husband though he called her wife
it was just this night when moon was full
and the stars were just right and the dress was real tight
had her soundin like lisa lisa  i wonder if i take you home
will you still love me after this night
mike was the hardhead from the around the way
that she wanted all her life shit she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
he was a willie all her life he wasnt really the one to like
it was a dude named shy who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but isis liked this broadway life
she loved the gucci sneakers the red green and whites
hangin out the window when she first seen him fight
she was so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight that
turned into a homicide thatll alter their life
see mike at thirtytwo was still on the scene
had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
sure he saw him as an infant but he dissed on him like
if that was my son he would look much different
see im lightskinnded and that baby theres dark
so its mommas baby poppas maybe
mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets 
had his old reliable thirtyeight gun in his reach
its been fourteen years him and isis aint speak
he runnin around like lifes a peach til one day
he approached this thug that had a mean mug
and it looked so familiar that he called him young cuz
told him get off the strip but the boy aint budge 
instead he pulled out a newer thirtyeight snub
he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused 
there was somethin in this mans face he knew he seen before
its like lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature
and he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
you know what they say about he who hesitates in war
 he who hesitates is lost
he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank
the old man didnt think he just followed his instinct
six shots into his kid out of the gun
niggaz be a father youre killin your son
six shots into his kid out of the gun
niggaz be a father you killin your sons
meet the parents  send correction to this typist
 some how some way
we gotta make it up out the hood some day
some how some way
we gotta make it up out this life
some how some way
we gotta make it up out this life
some way we gotta make it up out this life
weather we dribble out this motherfucker

some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker

and yall buy the shit caught up in the hype
cause the nigga wear a coofie it dont mean that he bright

it just means you dont understand all the bullshit that he write
is it oochie wally wally or is it one mic
is it black girl lost or shorty owe you for ice
ive been real all my life they confuse it with conceit
since i will not lose they try to help him cheat
but i will not lose for even in defeat
theres a valuable lesson learned so it evens up for me
when the grass is cut the snakes will show
i gotta thank the little homie nas for that though
saving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes
and ima let karma catch up to jazo whoa

they were so scared they aint hit me once
young hov bout to go to the range
bout to work on perfecting my aimshawn carter was born december th
weighing in at ten pounds eight ounces
he was the last of my four children
the only one who didnt give me any pain when i gave birth to him
and thats how i knew that he was a special child
hi baby whats wrong  you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me is it something that ive done again
 you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me
they say they never really miss you til you dead or you gone
so on that note im leavin after this song
see you aint gotta feel no way about jay so long
at least let me tell you why im this way hold on
i was conceived by gloria carter and adnus reeves
who made love under the sycamore tree
which makes me a more sicker mc and my momma would claim
at ten pounds when i was born i didnt give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare i made up for birth when i got here
she knows my purpose wasnt hurt cause i aint perfect i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasnt matchin my gear
now im just scratchin the surface cause whats buried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
i went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
hold on
shawn was a very shy child growing up
he was into sports and a funny story is
at four he taught himself how to ride a bike
a twowheel at that isnt that special
but i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up
now all the teachers couldnt reach me and my momma couldnt beat me
hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me so
with that disdain in my membrane
got on my pimp game fuck the world my defense came
then dehaven introduced me to the game
spanish jose introduced me to caine im a hustler now
my gear is in and im in the incrowd
and all the wavy lightskinned girls is lovin me now
my selfesteem went through the roof man i got my swag
got a vocal from this girl when her man got bagged
plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had
supposedly  knowin nobody paid jaz whack ass
im gettin ahead of myself by the way i could rap
that came second to me movin this crack
give me a second i swear i would say about my rap career
til ninetysix came niggaz im here  goodbye
  talking
shawn used to be in the kitchen beating on the table and rapping 
and umm into the wee hours of the morning
and then i brought him a boombox
and his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts 
but that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble
goodbye to the game all the spoils the adrenaline rush
your blood boils you in a spot knowin cops could rush
at you in the drop you so easy to touch
no two days are alike except the st and th pretty much
and trust is a word you seldom hear from us
hustlers we dont sleep we rest one eye up
and a drought could define a man when the well dries up
you learn the worth of water
without work you thirst til you die  yup
and niggaz get tied up for product
and little brothers ring fingers get cut up
to show mothers they really got em
and this is the stress i lived with
til i decided to try this rap shit for a livin
i pray im forgiven  for every bad decision i made
every sister i played  cause im still paranoid to this day
and its nobody fault i made the decisions ive made
this is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
now if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black are you not entertained  are you not entertained

sponsored by just blaze and the good folks at rocafella records
fellow americans it is with the utmost pride and sincerity
 that i present this recording as a living testiment and recollection
 of history in the making during our generation
allow me to reintroduce myself
my name is hov oh htotheov
i used to move snowflakes by the oz
i guess even back then you can call me
ceo of the roc hov
fresh out the fryin pan into the fire
i be the music biz number one supplier
flyerflier than a piece of paper bearin my name
got the hottest chick in the game wearin my chain thats right
hov oh  not doc
but similar to them letters no one can do it better
i check cheddar like a food inspector
my homey strict told me dude finish your breakfast
so thats what ima do take you back to the dude
with the lexus fastforward the jewels and the necklace
let me tell you dudes what i do to protect this
i shoot at you actors like movie directors 
this aint a movie dog 
now before i finish let me just say
 i did not come here to show out did not come here to impress you
 because to tell you the truth when i leave here im gone
 and i dont care what you think about me  but just remember
 when it hits the fan brother whether its next year ten years 
 twenty years from now youll never be able to say
 that these brothers lied to you jack
ving aint lie
i done came through the block in everything thats fly
im like che guevara with bling on im complex
i never claimed to have wings on
nigga i get mine  by any means on whenever theres a drought
get your umbrellas out because thats when i brainstorm
you can blame shawn but i aint invent the game
i just rolled the dice tryin to get some change
and i do it twice aint no sense in me
lyin as if i am a different man
and i could blame my environment but
there aint no reason why i be buyin expensive chains
hope you dont think users are the only abusers
niggaz gettin high within the game
if you do then how would you explain
im ten years removed still the vibe is in my veins
i got a hustler spirit nigga period
check out my hat yo peep the way i wear it
check out my swag yo i walk like a ballplayer
no matter where you go you are what you are player
and you can try to change but thats just the top layer
man you was who you was fore you got here
only god can judge me so im gone
either love me or leave me alone
 now back to our regular scheduled program 
   le album noir  the black album uhh this feel right right here quik
its like its sposed to happen this one right here

then  rocafella yall its your boy s dot
and i aint never been to jail i aint never pay a nigga
to do no dirt for me i was scared to do myself
i will never tell even if it means sittin in a cell
i aint never ran never will
i aint never been smacked a nigga better keep his hands
to himself or get clapped for whats under that mans belt
i never asked for nothin i dont demand of myself
honesty loyalty friends and then wealth
death before dishonor and i tell you what else
i tighten my belt fore i beg for help
foolish pride is what held me together through the years
i wasnt felt which is why i aint never played myself
i just play the hand im dealt i cant say ive never knelt
before god and asked for better cards at times to no avail
but i never sat back feelin sorry for myself
if you dont give me heaven ill raise hell
til its heaven
justify my thug  
my thug 
my thug  for you
to justify my thug
my thug 
my thug  for you
now if you shoot my dog ima kill yo cat
just the unwritten laws in rap  know dat
for every action theres a reaction dont have me relapsin
relaxins what im about but about mine
dont be actin like you cant see street action
take me back to reasonable doubt time
you see my minds on the finish line facin the wreck
i put my muhfuckin faith in the tec tell satan not yet
you understand i am chasin my breath
i am narrowly escapin my death oh yes
i am the michael schumacher of the roc roster
travellin mach  barrel in my apparel can stop god
god forgive me but i cant let them deliver me to you
until i won this race then eventually
my engine gon burn out i get whatever is meant for me
however it turns out fine  red line
they say an eye for an eye we both lose our sight
and two wrongs dont make a right
but when you been wrong and you know all along that its just one life
at what point does one fight 
fore you knock the war try to put your dogs in it
tenandahalfs for a minuteandahalf
bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
when you play the game of life and the win aint in the bag
when your options is none and the pen is all you have
or the block niggaz standin tight as lemons on the ave
tryin to cop a shop  call theyself cleansin in the cash
but cant put they name on paper cause then you on blast
mr president theres drugs in our residence

i gotta thing for them big body benzes it dulls my senses
in love with a vdub engine
man im high off life fuck it im wasted
bathing ape kicks audemar piguet wrists
my women friend get tennis bracelets
trips to venice get they winters replaced with
the sun it aint even fun no more im jaded
man its just a game i just play it to play it
i put my feet in the footprints left to me
without sayin a word the ghettos got a mental telepathy
man my brother hustled so naturally
up next is me but what perplexes me
shit i know how this movie ends still i play
the starrin role in hovitos way
its just life i solemnly swear
to change my approach stop shavin coke
stay away from hoes put down the toast
cause i be doin the most oh no
but every time i felt that was that it called me right back
it called me right back man it called me right back  oh no
im like a russian mobster drinkin distilled vodka
til im under the field with hoffa its real
peel the top up like a toupee
mix the water with the soda
turn the pot up make a souflee
all of yall can get it like groupays in your way
im livin proof that crime do pay
say hooray to the bad guy and all the broads
puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game
puttin caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
all in the name of love
just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
over the house to take back everything that they claimed
or even the worst pain is the distress
learnin youre the mistress only after that love gets slain
and the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
now it gets tough to ever love again
but the allure of the game keeps callin your name
to all the allurists of the world i feel your pain
to all the christies in every cities and tiffany lanes
we all hustlers in love with the same thang
i never felt more alive than ridin shotgun
in clines green  until the cops pulled guns
and i tried to smoke weed to give me the fix i need
what the game did to my pulse with no results
and you can treat your nose and still wont come close
the game is a lightbulb with eleventymillion volts
and im just a moth addicted to the floss
and doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
by any means necessary whatever the cost
even if it means lives is lost
and i cant explain why i just love to get high
drink life smoke the blueberry sky blink twice
im in the blueberry  you blink three times
i may not even be alive
i mean james dean couldnt escape the allure
dyin young leavin a good lookin corpse
of course
once again its the life
i said its the life
once again its the life  oh no
 why i 
get so  uhhuh
hahahahahahaha  wooim just tryin to stay above water yknow
just stay busy stay workin
puff told me like the key to this joint
the key to staying on top of things
is treat everything like its your first project knahmsayin
like its your first day like back when you was an intern
like thats how you try to treat things like just stay hungry
uhh uhh yes yes
yall wanna know why he dont stop
yall wanna know why he dont flop
let me tell you peeople why
came from the bottom of the block i
when i was born it was sworn i was never gon be shit
had to pull the opposite out this bitch
had to get my riide on
eyes on the prize shawn knew i had to
had to had to get these chips
had to make moves like olajuwon
started out sellin dimes and nicks
graduated to a brick
no exaggeration my infatuation with the strip
legendary like a schoolboy
crushin merely nearly every every chick
heavy shit  thats how schoolboy got whipped
and got left on some just me myself and i
on some trugoy shit
had your boys threw place up to a place of no return
had to play with fire and get burned
only way the boy ever gon learn
had to lay way in the cut til i finally got my turn
now im on top in the spot that i earned
its my life  its my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
its my everything
like i never rode in a limo
like i just dropped flows to a demo
like its ninetytwo again and
and i got os in the rental
back in the stu again no prob livin was a whole lot simpler
when you think back you thought that
you would never make it this far then you
take advantage of the luck you handed
or the talent you been given
aint no half steppin aint no no slippin
aint no different from a block thats hidden
gotta get it while the gettings good
gotta strike while the irons hot fore you stop
then you gotta bid it good riddance
goodbye this is my second major breakup
my first was with a pager
with a hooptie a cookpot and the caine
this ones with the stool with the stage with the fortune
maybe not the fortune but certainly the fame
its my life  my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me
its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst like the first song i sang
woo its like the blues  we gon ride out on this one

even though i dont act like it
even though i hear my calling and fight it
fools do me so wrong its hard to stay righteous
if pimping was a mountain to heaven id hike it

all we wanna see is them hands up hands up
this is for them hustlin boys and girls
its the return of best of both worlds
well once upon a time they left the glove and the star kid
he swore he was the man but he was nothing but garbage
let me rephrase that bubblin with pride
did have skills but he was ugly inside
instead of uplift folks sittin on the non sense
hurtin people feelings like he didnt have a conscience
like i love you when hes hittin that stash
then degraded the shorty like he didnt have class
even let a gay jew man tack his jheri
then got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy
swindlin forgot the god above him
finally fan base trinklin down to nothing
no concern for his estate though was yearnin for a break
bitter and evil didnt learn from his mistake
the moral of the story is dont be a pair of knickers
be good boys and girls and you can be as great as
rick is
my baby mommas robe my rent is overdue
it took half the pay and now my life is filled with rainy days
but i stashed some dough how much youll ever know

shoulda stayed in food and beverage
too much flossing
too much sam rothstein
i aint a bitch but i gotta divorce them
hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
and i aint even want to be famous
niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
and i aint even know how it came to this
except that fame is
the worst drug known to man
its stronger than heroin

you lost one

i dont think its meant to be be
but she loves her work more than she does me
and honestly at twentythree
i would probably love my work more than i did she
so we aint we
its me and her
cause what she prefers over me is work
and thats where we differ
so i have to give her
free time even if it hurts
so breathe mami its deserved
youve been put on this earth to be
all you can be like the reserves
and me my time in the army its served
so i have to allow she her time to serve
the times now for her
in time shell mature
and maybe we can be we again like we were
finally my times too short to share

lose one let go to get one
left one lose some to win some 
sorry im a champion sorry im a champion

life is but a dream to me
i dont wanna wake up
thirty odd years without having my cake up
so im about my paper
  in a leap year
i dont know why we here
since we gotta be here
life is but a beach chair
went from having shabby clothes
crossing over abbey roads
hear my angels singing to me
are you happy hov
i just hope im hearing right
karmas got me feearing life
colleek are you praying for me
i got deamons in my past
so i got daughters on the way
if the prophecys correct
then the child should have to pay
for the since of a father
so i barter my tommorows
against my yesterdays
in hopes that shell be ok
and when im no longere here
the shade of face from the flare
ill give her my share of carols daughter
and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave 
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave
life is but a dream to me
gun shots sing to these
other guys but lullabys
dont mean a ting to me
im not afraid of dyng
im afraid of not trying
everyday hit every wave
like im hawaiian
i dont surf the net
no i never been on myspace
too busy letting my voice vibrate
carving out my space
in this world of fly girls
cutthroats   diamond cut ropes i twirls
benzs round corners
where the sun dont shine
i let the wheels give a glimpse
of hope of ones grind
some said hov how you get so fly
i said from not being afraid to fall out the sky
my physicals shell
so when i say farewell
my soul will find an even
higher plane to dwell
so fly you shall
so have no fear just know that
life is but a beach chair
life is but a dream cant mimic my life
im the thinnest cut slice
intercut the winners cup
with winters rough enough
to interrupt life
thats why im both
the saint  the sinner
nice
this is jay everyday
no compromise
no compass comes with this life
just eyes
so to map it out
you must look inside
sure books can guid you
but your heart defines you
chica
you corason is what brought us home
in great shape like heidi klum
maricon i am on
permanent vaca
life is but a beach chair
this song is like a hallmark card
until you read each here
so till shes here
and she declaired
the aire
i will be prepared
a blueprint for you to print
a map so you can back
a guide for your eyes
and so you wont lose scent
ill make a stink for you to think
i ink these verses full of prose
so you wont get connect out of  cent
my last will and testament i leave my heir
my share of rocafella records and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing deliver me from my enemies oh god
defend me from all that rise up against me
deliver me from the work of inequity
and save me from the bloody mary
look mind state of a gangster from the s
meets the business mind of motowns berry gordy
turned crack rock into a chain of s
sorry my jewelry is so gaudy
slid into the party with my new pair of mauris
america meet the gangster shawn corey
hey young world wanna hear a story
close your eyes and you can pretend youre me
im cut from the cloth of the kennedys
frank sinatra havin dinner with the genovese
this is the genesis of a nemesis
mother americas not witnessed since
the harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
this is the tale of lost innocence
as the incense burns and the turntables turn
and that al green plays
i see my mothers afro
as mama taps her toes as she rolls her js
and my papa just left the house
in search of the killer of my uncle ray
and shes trying to calm her nerves
as i observe this is just one day
and what tomorrow has in store
we can never be sure so all we can do is pray
because of your strength
while i walk the pond of eden
for god is my deep fix 
as i head to my homeroom
i observe the ruins
dope needles on the ground
i hear a car go vroom
drug dealer in the bm with the top down
as the girls start to giggle
i ask why you laugh
they say youre too little
one day youll understand
when you become a man
bout things you have to get you
fast forward freeze frame on my pistol fistful of dollars
ignorance is so blissful
i aint choose this life this life chose me
around here its the shit that you just do
i just left school
the same bm is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
they had their guns drawn
screaming just move
or is there something else you suggest we can do
he made his way to the trunk
opened it like huh
a treasure chest was removed
cops said hell be back next month
what we called corrupt he calls payin dues
now when the rules is blurred
as they is and were
what am i to do but pray
pray the lord forgive me
pray he guides me by for what im bout to go through pray
 
deliver me in thy righteousness
and cause me to escape
and climb thine air internal
save me thine lord 
geah anywhere theres oppression
the drug profession
flourishes like beverages
refreshing ahhh sweet taste of sin
everything i seen made me everything i am
bad drug dealer or victim i beg
what came first 
moving chickens or the egg
this i why i be so fresh
im trying to beat life cause i cant cheat death
treat shame with shamelessness
and stainless at anuses
you know the game this is
move coke like pepsi
dont matter what the brand name is
i stand behind mine
everything i do im a man behind mine
im not an angel im sure
but every night before i lay
i drop my knees to the floor and i pray
the name shall endure forever
the name shall be continued as long as the sun 
men shall be blessed in him
all nations shall call him blessed
in your name i pray 
lord bless usdreamed of you this morning
then came the dawn and
i thought you were here with me

i wanna thank you for the fuel no really thank you

especially when the only thing i did was speak in class  ill teach his ass
even betters what my uncle did
i popped my demo tape in started to beat my head
peaked out my eye see if he was beatin his
he might as well say beat it kid hes on the list
its like im searchin for kicks like a sneaker head
he gon keep pushin me until i reach the ledge
and when i reach the ledge ill tell em all to eat a dick
take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread spread spread
the motivation for me 
was them tellin me what i could not be oh well
hey hey
im so ambitious  i might hit two sisters 
hey im on a mission  no matter what the conditions 
forget the personal issues  when you been what i been through 
hey if you believe it  then you could conceive it 
yeah yeah yeah
i had to lace up my boots even harder
father is too far away to father furthermore all the 
kids either smoke reefer or either

so they made light of my type of
dreams seem dumb they said wise up

heaven can wait were only watchin the skies
hopin for the best but expecting the worst
are you gonna drop the bomb or not
let us die young or let us live forever
we dont have the power but we never say never

the musics full of sad men

and the worst thing worst then getting old is not getting old

and watch the hoes when they bump into your clothes
and i hope they shine

moan turn those hollers to screams as we zone like a college team
then they can hear you from hollis queens 
life with me consists of a lot of things
chips in your ear hit the dirt cause you got hotter things
but you know how to scream friends talking dizziness
remind them freak chicks to stay out my business

in first class if my ass should crash champagne spilled on me

i dont want no romance i just want the chance
cant knock the hustle for real
verse three

these rap dudes can flip but some of them aint even rhyming for chips
what part of the game is this
seems brainless on tours with whores thats what im saying i miss
cats that go all out for their gold plaques
starting out with four jacks ended up with gold acs

on the weight of me through you screw you
gun blew you i didnt want to choose you

youre wasting your talent randy

its like a whirlwind inside of my head
its like i cant stop what im hearing within
its like the face inside is right
why does it look like night today
something in heres not right today
why am i so uptight today
paranoias all i got left
i dont know what stressed me first
or how the pressure was fed
but i know just what it feels like
to have a voice in the back of my head
its like a face that i hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time they lie
a face that laughs every time they fall
so you know that when its time to sink or swim
that the face inside is hearing me
right underneath my skin
you know i  thug em fuck em love em leave em
cause i dont fuckin need em
take em out the hood keep em lookin good
but i dont fuckin feed em
first time they fuss im breezin

then you drop a couple of hits look how they wave to you
from marcy to madison square
to the only thing that matters in just a matter of years 
as fate would have it jays status appears
to be at an alltime high perfect time to say goodbye
when i come back like jordan wearin the 
it aint to play games witchu
its to aim at you probably maim you
if i owe you im blowin you to smithereens
cocksucker take one for your team
and i need you to remember one thing 
i came i saw i conquered
from record sales to sold out concerts
so muh if you want this encore
i need you to scream til your lungs get sore
tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
and every second i waste is more than i can taaaakkee
ive become so numb
i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
ive become so nuuuuummmbbb
ive become so nuuuummmmbb
so for one last time i need yall to roar
 one last time i need yall to roar jayz lyrics from ohhlacom originally

i didnt look out below
i watch the time go right out the window
trying to hold on and didnt even know

take this ride make you feel it inside your belly
if its tight get the ky jelly

side to side til you say jayz youre too much for me
i am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints but i cant help the fact
that everybody can see these scars
i am what i want you to want what i want you to feel
but its like no matter what i do i cant convince you
to just believe this is real
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that im not

and now youre actin raw but you never had war
dont know how to carry your hoes wanna marry your hoe
now shes mad at me causer your majesty just happened to be
a pimp what a tragedy
she wanted us to end cause i fucked with friends
she gave me one more chance and i fucked her again
i seen her tears as she busted in i said shit
theres a draft shut the door bitch and come on in
i am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
cuz you dont understand i do what i can
sometimes i dont make sense
i am what you never wanna say but ive never had a doubt
its like no matter what i do i cant convince you for once just to hear me out
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do

if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
got em mike
hes got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure his caskets closed
rap critics that say hes money cash hoes
hes from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
if you grew up with holes in your zapatoes
youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
so fuck critics you can kiss the whole asshole
if you dont like the lyrics you can press fast forward
got beef with radio if we dont play they show
they dont play our hits  we dont give a shit so
all these mags try and use our ass
so advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
i dont know what you take us as
or understand the intelligence that jayz has
from rags to riches we aint dumb
we got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
 problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now the year is ninetyfour in my trunk is raw
in the rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
i got two choices yall pull over the car or 
bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor 
and i aint tryin to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
so i pull over to the side of the road i heard
  
cause im young and im black and my hats real low
or do i look like a mindreader sir  i dont know
am i under arrest or should i guess some mo
  well you was doin fiftyfive in the fiftyfour
  license and registration and step out of the car 
  are you carryin a weapon on you  i know a lot of you are
i aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
  
well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
  arent you sharp as a tack  you some type of
  lawyer or somethin somebody important or somethin
ha i aint passed the bar but i know a little bit
enough that you wont illegally search my shit
  
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
this is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
but a pussy havin no god damn sense try an push me
i try to ignore him talk to the lord
pray for him but some fools just love to perform
you know the type loud as a motorbike
but wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing thats gon happen is ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
and there i go trapped in the kitkat again
back through the system with the riffraff again
fiends on the floor scratchin again
paparazzis with they cameras snappin them
da try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mill for bail cause im african
all because this fool was harassin them
tryin to play the boy like hes saccharin
but aint nuttin sweet bout how i hold my gun
i got  problems b and a bitch aint one  hit me
shut up when im talkin to you
shut up shut up shut up
shut up when im talkin to you

but when i rap i come off like that without the glitches
never crossed the black cat with the riches
im leaving stevie sayin no wonder youre superstitious
beef im with it simple yall can all get it
yall dont all get it
dont nobody of mind for this matter
can gather the data until ya mind dont matter
i bubble like lather hustle like the leadoff batter
cause all that matters is the money til it aint funny
you feel me when the beast screams kill me
dont jerk me boy i rip it silly
ill let you rise of course but if you dont fall off on your own
emcees i cut off at the knees like shorts
it gets worst if you dont care for my sick thoughts like a nurse
with no known remedy im leaving boys and men on bended knee till the end of the road
i lie low forget this record shit with one sale
check it out
the nerve of these herbs
yall know which swerve from the curb in the lax
the best observe
im splashing splurging dashing thats my word ya know
champagne glass is crashing cant ration
used to having a whole lot so dough i blow a lot
had a buck fifty while you were still taking skibby to school
ran with one of them cats that hides tiffanys for them jewels
back when duke was jumping out of cabs in krush groove

dreaming alive but look what it got me

like the point guard off your favorite team without doubt
my life aint rosy but i roll with it
my mind was fine until the dough hit it and told me that the mo did it
and now its kosher shit is so hasidic
i blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but no bitches

tryin to strike a bargain hoping that they might get pardoned
shit im involved with got me pins and needles
and my cerebral bes the wickedess evil thoughts that this martyr feed you
feedback in the game so deep fiends could catch ya
freeze off my knee cap can yall believe that

my rise to riches surprised the bitches  think harder

now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours 
 history so long so long
so long so long
in search of victory she keeps saluting me
if only we can be together momentarily
we can make love and make history
why wont you visit me until she visit me
ill be stuck with her sister her name is defeat
she gives me agony so much agony
she brings me so much pain so much misery
like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
as the crowd screams for the other team
i practiced so hard for this moment victory dont leave
i know what this means im stuck in this routine
whole new different day the same old thing
all i got is dreams nobody else can see
nobody else believes nobody else but me
where are you victory i need you desperately
not just for the moment to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long 
 so long so long
so now im flirting with death 
hustling like a g while victory wasnt watching took chances repeatedly
as a teenage boy before acne before i got proactive i couldnt face she
i just threw on my hoody and headed to the street
i swear i met success we lived together shortly
now success was like lust shes good to the touch
shes good for the moment but shes never enough
everybodys had her shes nothing like v
but success is all i got unfortunately
but im burning down the block hoping in and out of v
but something tells me there is much more to see
before i get killed cause i cant get robbed
so before me success and death ménage
i gotta get lost i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battle finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long
so long so long
now victory is mine taste so sweet
shes my trophy wife your coming with me
well have a baby who stutters repeatedly
well name him history hell repeat after me
hes my legacy son of my hard work
future of my past thatll explain who ill be
rank me amongst the greats either one two or three
if i aint number one then ive failed you victory
aint in it for the fame that dies within weeks
aint in it for the money can take it when you leave
i want to be remembered long after you breathe
long after im gone long after i breathe
i leave all i am in the hands of history
thats my last will testimony
this is much more than a song its a baby shower 
ive been waiting for this hour history of ours
now that all the smoke is gone
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours
history so long so long
so long so longwhen the sky falls and the earth quakes
we gon put this back together
we wont break
sa pa sé my portauprinces
my haitian gods and all of my princesses
our condolences as you fightin against this
were right by your side as we tryin to make sense of this
heavenly father help us see through these problems
and for those that left accept them into your garden
so heres my theory the countrys already starvin
so we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
god please pardon i speak from the heart
its the only way i see this tragedy befall on them
so lets get involved with them hand to hand with them
arm to arm with them til they get strong again
when the sky falls
cant wait until tomorrow
haiti mon amour
haiti mon amour
not gonna leave you stranded alone alone
oh no
learn from the past new orleans was flooded
so we know we just cant rely on the government
we under the rubble again here we go rumbling when
when we gon catch a break my friend lost his mother and then
and then carline lost her uncles and them
buried with no caskets they just put covers on them
and the tears fall and we fight back
story aint done it cant end like that
nah not like this tomorrows survivors gonna carry on your name
you live on inside us your memorys alive with us
you inspired us to rebuild this country you just guide us
its not the angels that are on their way
its not the bells of santa trinite
the people waiting positions vacant
for hands to help not just to pray
haïti va sélever
tu vas te relever
nous nous éléverons
ensemble ensemble ensemble
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break send corrections to the typist

transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch and then you die
but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but 
makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
we paid the price the circle of success they turned my mic up

if every nigga in your clique is rich yo clique is rugged
nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches
i hope you fools choose to listen i drop jewels bust it
these are the rules i follow in my life you gotta love it
jiggy jigga lookin gully in the joint 
if yall niggas aint talkin bout large money whats the point

them dreams you say you got give me the chills
but these mills well they make me hot  yall dont feel me
enough to stop the illin right
but at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
im so confused okay im gettin weeded now
i know i contradicted myself look i dont need that now 
its just once in a blue and its nothin to do and
the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through

i freed my mind sometimes i here myself moanin
take one more toke then i leave that weed alone man
it got me goin shit
  repeat xthis shit is wicked on these mean streets
none of my friends speak
were all trying to win but then again
maybe its for the best though cause when theyre seeing too much
you know theyre trying to get you touched
whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldnt understand the mechanics
and the workings of the underworld granted
nine to five is how to survive i aint trying to survive
im trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
life ills poison my body
i used to say fuck mic skills
and never prayed to god i prayed to gotti
thats right its wicked thats life i live it
aint asking for forgiveness for my sins ends
i break bread with the late heads picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the gamell do
it gets dangerous money and power is changing us
and now were lethal infected with devils
we used to fight for building blocks
now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
the closest of friends when we first started
but grew apart as the money grew and soon grew blackhearted
thinkin back when we first learned to use rubbers
he never learned so in turn im kidnappin his babys mother
my hand around her collar feeding her cheese
she said the taste of dollars was shitty so i fed her fifties
about his whereabouts i wasnt convinced
so i kept feedin her money til her shit started to make sense
who could ever foresee we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
now im tryin to rock this bitch to sleep
all the years we were real close
now i see his fears through her tears
know shes wishin we were still close
dont cry it is to be
in time ill take away your miseries and make em mine devils
my flesh no nigga could test
my soul is possessed by devils in the form of diamonds and lexuses
the exorcist got me doing skits like homie
you dont know me but the whole world owe me  strip
was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
so now im down for whatever aint nothing nice
throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
but now this higher learning got the remy in me
liquors invaded my kidneys
got me ready to lick off mama forgive me
i cant be held accountable devils beatin me down boo
got me runnin with guys making gs tellin lies that sound true
come test me i never cower
for the love of money son im giving lead showers

look if i shoot you im brainless
but if you shoot me then youre famous  whats a ngga to do
when the streets is watching blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it thats the fastest way to get extorted
but my time is money at twentyfive i cant afford it
beef is sorted like godiva chocolates
nggaz you bought it i pull the slide back and cock it
plan aborted you and your mans get a pass
this rhyme youre operating on fck time
yall nggaz aint worth my shells all yall nggaz
tryin to do is hurt my sales and stop trips to john mcnale
the type to start a beef then run to the cops
when i see you in the street got one in the drop
when id rather be on tour gettin a hundred a pop
taking pictures with some btches in front of the drop
the streets is watching
when the streets is watching
blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it
now its hard not to kill nggaz
its like a full time job not to kill nggaz cant chill
the streets is watchin when you froze your arms
nggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm
cant get caught with your feet up gotta keep your heat up
sweet nggaz running round swearing sht is sweeter
once youre tagged lame the game is follow the leader
everybody want a piece of your scrilla so you gotta keep it realer
kidnap nggaz wanna steal ya
broke nggaz want no cash they just wanna kill ya
for the name nggaz dont know the rules
disrespectin the game want you to blow your cool
force your hand of course that mans plottin
smarten up the streets is watchin its on
my street mentality flip bricks forever know me and money
we like armed codefendants ngga we stick together
sht whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
hustle harder to see it if indictment time came around
and you can look up and down the streets and i cant be found
put in twentyfour hour shifts but that aint me now
got a face too easy to trace nggaz mouths got slow leaks
had to hide between my workers couldnt play those streets
she out of space like mercury you jerkin me  hectic
had to call upon my wolves to send nggaz the message
i said this lets play fair and we can stay here
im trying to transform you boyz ii men like daycare
hey theres money to be made and nggaz got the picture
stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
then hard times fell upon us half of my staff
had warrants the other half in the casket lay dormant
i felt like life was cheating me for the first time
in my life i was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me
was this a lesson god teaching me  was he saying that
im playing the game straight from hell from which few came back
like bad coke pimp or die was my mindframe bad
was nggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack
aint a whole lot of brain to that just trying to maintain a stack
and not collide like two trains thats on the same track         
but get my life together like the oars i bring back
in the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
got my transporter take it cross the border then stop
to set up shop with a quarter of rock  heres the plan
for three straight weeks nggaz slaughtered the block
but you know the game is lluted fcked up me and my dues
one drop can wipe a ngga out faster than the cops
and this unstable way of living just had to stop
half of my nggaz got time we done real things
by ninetyfour became the subject of half of yall nggaz rhymes
public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street
but thats the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets
the life and times of a demonic mind excited with crime
and the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
i figured sht why risk myself i just write it in rhymes
and let you feel me and if you dont like it then fine
the mindstate of a ngga who boosted the crime rate
so high in one city they send national guards to get me
ya dig
the streetsverse one
im done talking
ran up in the spot gun smoking
shot it in the air one woke him
sunsoaking sweating in his bed like dunlo
thinking to himself what done provoked him
his thoughts is racing like a vulcan
i swear i saw a lightbulb when
he finally figured out who was the culprit
i said yeah remember me from friend or foe when
i told you dont ever ever come around here no more
time to pay now you try to rise i wave the gun  lay down
this time youre really going to listen to jay now
i try to talk sensibly hoping that eventually you realize
i had this locked and it just wasnt meant to be
plus i had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
and it wasnt afterthought that maybe youll try to revenge me
but i was like nah chromes had to know he was wrong
and if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
plus you promised
and thats really no fun 
yeah i find you in this motel  with all these guns
and all your goons lined up in adjoining rooms
like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
but my minds like a flower in bloom
 my eyes just scower the room
im alert plus i paid the clerk i got it laid out
you think you the first nigga i played out in a  hotel town 
come on now i peep your lexus at you
left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
money well invested rudely interrupted
jamaican accents  
a gun in your face and thats all you can come up with
im done talking back up and clap them one in the abdomen 
do me a favor dude get  ice cubes i pass them
take that ice up for the nicest mc
and please yo tell big hes unbelievable 
friend or foe biotchhow can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in
theres gotta be them times youll be wrong nah mean
how can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga 
he never even met that he dont even know and shit
i think this rap shit is all beef
yall dont even know every day im livin with stress
got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
cant even enjoy myself at a party unless
im on the dance floor hot ass vest

its gon be on both feet never knees in the dirt
you could try me fucka but when i squeeze it hurts fine
well lose two lives yours and mines
gimme any amount of time dont let ms carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin tears on my sleeve
told the judge didnt budge it was him or me
and i aint trying to be hard but im guilty as charged
put my mercy on this court and my faith in god 
and pray hard none of my nephews wanna be starslucky me
chorus karen anderson
you only know what you see

niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own

chorus karen anderson jayz
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me 
and now that ive arrived
i see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold
nigga see you in the street pretend to be friendly
but i know any type of success breeds envy
i know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me
leave my friends in a circle pouring out henny
but gs is heaven bound so how im gon receive 
anything yall pour to the ground next time throw it up
and aint nothing changed so even in my afterlife i show it up
dont grieve for me my art remains
like a dart from the speaker to your heart
spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal
plan to leave without a fight i plant a seed i give life
though i cant see past the girls greed to call her wife

just a breeze not enough to catch a real vibe
then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five

cuts and scratchesuhhuh jeje jejejeah 
yeyeyeah yeyeyeah
how real is this how real is this
uhhuh huh inspect this here check
verse one
im from where the hammers rung news cameras never come
you and your man houndin every verse in your rhyme
where the grams is slung niggas vanish every summer
where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can and run
where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
to achieve this goal quicker sold all my weight wet
faced with immeasurable odds still i get straight bets
so i felt some more something and you nothing check
i from the other side with other guys dont walk to much
and girls in the projects wouldnt fuck us if we talked too much
so they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
i dont know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us
im from where the beef is inevitable summertimes unforgetable
boosters in abundance buy a halfprice sweater new
your world was everything so everything you said youd do
you did it couldnt talk about it if you aint lived it
i from where niggas pull your car and argue all day about
whos the best mcs biggie jayz and nas
where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
at each others throats for the love of foreign cars
where cats catch cases hoping the judge r and rs
but most times find themselves locked up behind bars
im from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
im from marcy son just thought id remind yall
chorus 
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
mentally been many places but im brooklyns own
verse two
im from the place where the chruch is the flakiest
and niggas is praying to god so long that they atheist
where you cant put your vest away and say youll wear it tomorrow
cause the day after well be saying damn i was just with him yesterday
im a block away from hell not enough shots away from straight shells
an ounce away from a triple beam still using a handheld weight scale
your laughing you know the place well
where the liqour stores and the base well
and government fuck government niggas polotic themselves
where we call the cops the ateam
cause they hop out of vans and spray things
and life expectancy so low we making out wills at eightteen
where how you get rid of guys who step out of line your rep solidifies
so tell me when i rap you think i give a fuck who criticize
if the shit is lies god strike me
and i got a question are you forgiving guys who live just like me
well never know
one day i pray to you and said if i ever blow let em know
mistakes aint exactly what takes place in the ghetto
promise fulfilled but still i feel my job aint done
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
chorus 
verse three
im from where they crossover and clap boards
lost jehovah in place of rap lords listen
im up the block round the corner and down the street
from where the pimps prostitutes and the drug lords meet
we make a million off of beats cause our stories is deep
and fuck tomorrow as long as the night before was sweet
niggas get lost for weeks in the streets twisted off weed
and no matter the weather niggas know how to draw heat
whether your fourfeet or minute size it always starts out with
three dice and shoot the five
niggas thought they douce was live now hit em with trips
and i reached down for their money pa forget about this
this time around its platinum like the shit on my wrist
and this glock on my waist yall cant do shit about this
niggas will show you love thats how they fool thugs
before you know it your lying in a pool of blood
chorus kelly price 
talking throughout my life 
no matter what ive done
youve been merciful and your love endureth 
through all things  for that
i am eternally grateful
verse 
since my date of birth
bought you nothing but hurt
play those video games
stole change from ya purse
sat on the cold court bench
til i was arraigned in ya skirt
saw the pain in ya face
through you maintained a smirk
all you did was motivate me
dont let em hold you back
what i do i turned around
and i sold you crack
i was a bastard for that
still im drowning in shame
just remember one thing now
youre not to blame
you was newly seperated
tryin to escape ya world
and through my thirst
i didnt help you
i just made things worse
i hated me and everybody
that created crack
had me thinkin
the newest kicks and the latest gat
still havent apologized
so please play this back
while i try to come to terms
with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way
cocaine numbs the brain
all i did was think about
how the funds once came
then i ran across this memory 
and it stung the brain
how can you ever destroy the beauty
from which one came
thats a savage youre the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why i rhyme above average and
i aint shit
glad you got yourself together
no thanks to me
strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
you must love me
chorus  
say that you love me
all i know say that you must love me
ohh yeah
verse 
we used to fight every night
but i never would suffer
just smile my big brothers
tryna make me tougher
as we grew fussing and fighting continued
as i plundered through ya stuff
and snuck ya clothes to school
got intense real intense
as we got older
never believed it would lead
to be popped in one of ya shoulda
with my rings knew you had it
cause you took too long
as mickey andy and the girl that bought it looked on
huffin and puffin gun in my hand
told you step outside
hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
made our way down the steps
maybe you thought it was just a threat
or maybe ya life was just that crazy
and you was beggin for death
try to justify this in my young mind
but ya drillin it
and my ego hurt combined
drove me berzerk
saw the devil in your eyes
high off more than weed
confused i just closed
my young eyes and squeezed sorry boys
but all the money in the world couldnt bring me back again
lay down lay down
gonna stretch my mic out in ponce funeral home on marcy
all those new niggaz stop there
but a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
the last of the real hustlers well
maybe not the last
bleeks gonna be a good rapper
new improved jayz
i quit
im retirin
aint enough money in this game to keep me around

inspect the game yo thats right
 last week i had everything
 i had the money had the cars the bitches
 and the jewelry
	and then my motherfuckin niggaz started snitchin
 beyotch
growin up in the hood just my dog and me
we used to hustle in the hood for all to see
problems i called on him he called on me
we wasnt quite partners i hit him off my p
met him unlocked doors off my keys
yeah we spoke much more than cordially
man he broke bread with me my business spread swiftly
the feds came to get me we both fled quickly
wasnt quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
got caught and thats when our relationship strayed
used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
and when he called collect and i heard his name
i quickly accepted but when i reached the phone
hes talkin reckless i can sense deceit in his tone
i said damn dawg what nine weeks and youre home
he said main man you think shits sweet cause youre home
i just sat spat no more speech in the phone
the crackers up there bleachin your dome youre reachin
i said the world dont stop ive got to keep keep on
from there i sensed the beef was on
i ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
to see if i had bugs and leeches on my phone
cant be too safe cause niggaz is twofaced
and they show the other side when they catch a new case
its on
it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i dont see how this side of you could be provoked
funny what seven days can change
a stand up nigga now you sit down to aim
used to have a firm grip now you droppin names
uhhuh uhhuh 
like i put the toast to your head and made you sell
we both came in this game blind as hell
i did a little better had more clientele
told you put away some cheddar now you cryin for bail
seventeen and im holdin on to around a mill
i could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill
had niggaz thinkin i was from uptown for real
i had so much hustle plus i was down to ill
like a brooklyn nigga straight out of brownsville
down and dirty down to fight the round thirty
freezin on them corners still holdin my crack
lookin up and down the block the fuck is the dough at
came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
you tell them feds i said im never goin back
im from marcy and marcy dont raise no rats
you know the consequences of your acts you cant be serious
the lawyer i retained you said you leakin some things
all this after a week in the bang
im mad at myself cause i didnt spot the weak and lame
i woulda bet the house you wouldnt speak a thang
nigga this was the oath to the top of broke
even pricked our finger anything that got between us
we sposed to cock the ninas what happened to that
instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
fuck it the same thing make you laugh make you cry
thats right the same game that make you mad could make you die
its a dice game and sometimes you crap
who woulda thought youd get popped one time and rap
now you know thats bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up like this is my dad
the labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
youll always be in jail nigga just minus the bars
shit is crazy man
all these niggaz out here snitchin
we was one step away from takin this crack money
and recyclin it through the ghettoes
and buildin back up our own hoods
now all you niggaz start snitchin on each other

i felt his hatred it was harsh fore this fakin shit start
i should take him in back of the building and blaze him
uhoh this nigga jay he aint slow he musta picked up on the vibe
and had i not been so high i woulda been able to hide
tried to cover up myself as i gave him a five
hugged him as if i loved him
to the naked eye
it woulda seemed we was the closest but to those that know us
could see that somethin was about to go down
stay focused
im tryin to concentrate but its like hes reading my mind
as if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
could he see i had plans on bein the man
ever since we first spoke and he put that g in my hand
and i gave it back to show him i was down for the cause
as he approached  and i paused

	serena altschuls here live outside the criminal courthouse
	this is  yall
	in new york city for the first day in the trial of 
	im gone 
	the state vs shawn carter aka jayz
	uhh uhhuhuh uhh uhhuhuh uhh
	whatever the verdict in this trial may be
	the effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide
aiyyo stand forward fore you take notice
or witness to me killin the track
testify til me spillin the smack
now they got me for traffickin racketeerin audio crack
	they call me dope man dope man
	i try to tell em im where hope floats man
	ghetto spokesman
a broke man approachin the bench with intent
to bury me under the cell fingered me as the toast man
evidence stemmin from ninetysix
they say the world aint recovered from his fix
while they was usin cut i was on some other shit
gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
nowaday the jury got they brow raised
listenin to testimony about my foul ways
exhibit a reasonable doubt
they say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
	you can feel the tension building here
	as an unprecedented number of people have turned out
	for what may be the trial of the century
how come you label your brand of dope
volume  and spread it through the slums
fed it to the young with total disregard
your honor the state seeks the maximum charge
and how could you turn right around
and release a lethal dosage called volume 
and is true you operate the criminal enterprise
known as rocafella in charge of his meteoric rise
and do you deny youre responsible for the demise
of record execs and do you object
your distributions polygram and through your connects
def jam you pushed over five million soundscan
and not to mention your cohorts and henchmen
dame biggs lyor kev and russell simmons
and we aint gon talk about murder inc
that just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
	the state is seeking the maximum penalty
	and with the overwhelming amount of evidence
	the das presented things arent looking good
	despite the grim outlook at this point
	the rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
	in the face of adversity
	jayz is taking the stand
right hand on the bible left hand in the air
before i spoke one word made sure my throat was clear
ahem im a prisoner of circumstance
frail nigga i couldnt much work with my hands
but my mind was strong i grew where you hold your blacks up
trap us expect us not to pick gats up
where you drop your cracks off by the mack trucks
destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
keep us spiralin goin backwards
at age nine saw my first hate crime
blindfolded expected to walk a straight line
mind molded taught to love you and hate mine
climbed over it at a early age jay shined
fuck the system at lady justice i blaze nine
your honor i no longer kill my people i raise mine
the soul of mumia in this modern day time
	while the jury is inside deliberating
	outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation
	well the verdict has just been announced not guilty
	it is complete pandemonium out here 
	people are cheering and hugging  there he is
	jayz is exiting the courtroom right now
	there is a swarm of cameras surrounding him 
	and people are just rushing up to him
	lets try and make our way over there jayz jayz
	uhhuh uh

let me explain this to you baby
i spent nights out days in
niggaz was blazing twelve noon where i was raised in
i felt caged in but kept roaming
prayed for the day of atonement
married to the streets no date of annulment
it seems every time it comes up
they postpone it
so i kept my chrome at the waist
waiting for the omen
savoring the moment and now you know
the reason that i flow the way i flow baby
its the things that you do
that make me feel so
and i dont know the way i feel
i can explains
i love you

defy websters words they cant pronounce like that
thats why no other rapper got a sound like that
trap trap of my life
flashback kill niggaz
rap skills unmatched jigga man baby
i cant entertain it sometimes i cant explain it
god given gifts of a soul for hard living

the quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
until i got a gat and loudly start poppin back
round the way niggaz called me bobby bouchete

chorus x
motherfuckerswho ever thought young shawn carter would change the game
used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
duckin the plain cops pushin indo and caine
at the kitchen table late night no pen just my brain
first album niggaz love me cause they thought i was poor
guess im successful industry dont love me no more
well im the same nigga from your corner bubblin raw
skully tilted pants saggin damn near touchin the floor
and i come with dorags to your socalled awards
tshirt with my chain out like fuck yall all

chorus 
cmon here baby you drive me crazy  
dont want nobody but you my baby 
hold me tight and call me your lady  
let me scream your name
i took ya outta jacobs in clusters
busters they wanted to rush us
love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
when you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
you can light up the whole room turning day from night
when the summertime is in and the tops are down
with you around my neck we lock the whole block down 
it took shortsleeves and loungin to understand
the reason they call you ice everybody freeze
aint a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
and that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
the direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
i used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
guess i was jealous that they was so next to you
so i devoted half my time to invest in you
the other half was spent on protecting you
cause you belong to me now sing ya song for me
cmon
chorus x
im often with you so they wonder bout the juice i got
i took you from the projects and an abusive pops
from the bottom to the top
the skateboard to the drop
from the nada to the prada
i got ya like i got ya
from the first time i put you round my neck and locked ya

you find a dude in town you send him a short message

cause most niggaz dont know a brick from a bike
they keep buyin hard white

fyi i never been robbed in my life
or  you find a chick shit you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you round town like her man
shake hands make friends like its all innocent
then  before they look up you sellin the town cookup
or  gorilla pimp come up on that killer shit
take a nigga brick smack him then you sell it back to them

uh huhyeah yeahmotherfuckers 
say that im foolish i only talk about jewels 
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothin i made somethin doin
what i do through and through and
i give you the news  with a twist its just his ghetto pointofview
the renegade you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture bring em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no hes not around  now how that sound to ya jot it down
i bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
i help them see they way through it  not you
cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth you lose your tie and your shirt
since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it with em a minute
cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference  theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict  like you didnt experiment
now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin dogooders  too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
 and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go  hes 
and im the sinister mr kissmyass its just the
 renegade  never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a renegade  never been afraid to talk
about anything  anything  renegade
 never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a  never been afraid to holler
about anything  anything 
i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
whatchu hollerin gotta pay rent bring dollars in
by the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
doorag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me  im awkward i box leftier often
my pops left me an orphan my momma wasnt home
could not stress to me i wasnt grown specially on nights
i brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor  thirty years my senior
my childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky
big i did it  multi before i die 
no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight
see im a poet to some a regular modern day shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatterbrained atheist
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter  a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see its easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water  no wonder they try to hold me under longer
im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube  motherfuckers hate to like you

we was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
mommas rent his young brothers clothes
my nephews food and with that i sqooze

okay lets do this 
things just aint the same for gangsters
but im a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
all of these rap singers claimin they bangers
doin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin the game no home trainin or manners
i was doin this shit when you was shittin pampers
i was movin them grams fore you knew what a hand that hand was
duckin the vans radars the scanners
fore you knew what hard white to tame was
i was hittin the turnpike aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cuss aight with them hammers

i had it laid out fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mill later now you understand us

the past present nigga the future proper
the holy trinity of hiphop is us
we give dre his props but thats where it stops
its the roc
i know you got your eyes on me

but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you bedda off not lookin at all
  
  
  
  
im still on top of the game
still droppin flames still cock and aim
still at the top had the roc for the fame
over setbacks theres been a lot since i came
you seen it all how i got how i gained
the momentum when it dropped how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock they watched me reclaim
the streets they made a special spot for my name
dre haters wanna stop to my reign
but the music lives in me every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the mane
see the world chear for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs itll drive them insane
the eyes that i played
the best to emerge in the game is the watcher
im rated r my brain contains graphics thangs
it turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
its like watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
which means i can see the whole planet in the scene
cash is the topic the object a fatter pocket
some take the crack and chop it but those that havent got it
take away the added profit its catastrophic
i take the gat and cock it and ill sit back and watch it
these new york streets is ugly i keep it gully
the world is mine and cant nobody keep it from me
yo my neighborhood is never sunny
in the place where the number one cause of death is money
you can try copin
ive seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
im still alive and scopin
be another hundred years til my skies close in
and ima die with my eyes open the watcher uhh uhh uhh

mommas youngest and strongest survived summers like saunas

pop hurtin assertive flirted with death
damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
grandmas favorite she could not understand
how theres people in the world who wouldnt want me as a neighbor
has to explain to her you think these folks want me in the penthouse
as a reminder that i make top paper
black entrepeneur nobody did us no favors
nobody gave us shit we made us
the rap pack im sinatra dames sam davis
bigs the smart one on the low like dean martin
we came in this game not beggin niggaz pardon
demandin yall respect hand over a check
and while yall at it hand over the jet
we the reason they aint hand over def jam so quick
they new every year i was droppin new product
i was raisin the stock up while buildin the roc up
but thats alright cause they knew they had to see us
when it was time for us to reup make us multimillionires
jejejeah
jeah  in my lifetime
i caught smaller cases but i had capital
hypocritic system let me right back at you
you better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
not even that scratches you specially if you black dude
they dont give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
and they can look good by paintin him as bad news
cause in my past i seen dudes get half of they views
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
so imagine how disturbed i was
when i seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
let me explain exactly how this shit was
this nigga un yo i scratched him he went home without an aspirin
but its cool cause hes back friends and halfinning is over
its in the past and im glad now im back to bein hova

helicopter seat feat inclined shit feelin like a sofa
helicopter meet me teta vero take me over
somewhere peaceful for the weekend now its back to speakin of vultures
so the next time that page six approaches us

flow like a  do what i wanna do
goin on my th ring got phil jacksons and
flow is black magic im at it again
rose bowl with black karats horse  carriage to spend
like mason betha chasin this cheddar to the end
of the road because the end im told is nearer than we know
what can i say but live for today hov
yeah the blueprint  homey follow the moves
you put on two tube socks you couldnt walk in my shoes
i was dealt a bad hand fuck what else could i do
but keep somethin up my sleeve thatll help me through
but can you believe everywhere im at models come through
catfightin catwalkin it happens often
its true how society dont want me to move
into the penthouse building with spectacular views
theyre like uhh hes a menace he could never be a tenant
im like ooh whats a young nigga to do
i bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that i dont
give a fuck we just chillin watchin chandelier ceilings high as fuck
old lady dont blow my high
specially if you dont know my life dont make me bring
sharpton in it cause im darkskinneded or
dude with the fro and the rainbow coalition ima
victim of a single parent household born in a mousehole
mousetrap niggaz wanna know
how so how jay get up out that here yeah
i snatched purses i persevered yeah
i had work fiends purchased it was clear
i was out there sellin hope for despair but stop there
i swear i only make good from my mouth to gods ears
had to get out the hood
and i cant justify genocide
but i was born in the city where the skinny niggaz die
born in the city where the skinny niggaz ride
and as a skinny nigga i had beef with high size 
yeah its magic
uhh jayz and lenny kravitz
and its a heavy d production you bastards
come on
ha hey yo stop playin man
this is real serious
ha  yeah yo
 
lets go
post postatono hov hangin with bono
u can live like salvatore ferragamo
and u can cool out poolside at the delano
and u flow like you was out of your mind yo
cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from mcdonalds
would soon be the boss of the big apple ya know
and who knew dude that played ball for the nba
would make a mistake on the who knew estates throw it away
who knew that would be his last shot who drew up that play
they giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
but even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
you could have turned guns into roses like two times today
now heres something you gotta say two times to jay
i got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
got my boom box suntan lotion waiting for action
they say when you play with skills good luck could happen
lets go
 
 its the roc 
thats right
 
things got too hot so i jumped off in this rap shit
you got it kriskrossed aint no turning me backwards
too many district attorneys concerned with the actions
of one individual hes criminally attached
i turned in all my rap chips im earning my bachelors
while dating all the models and actresses
im learning all the potholes in every single barrio
trying not to mess up my axis kid
on the road to the riches through trafficking
through rappining and whatevers happening
rocawear im the young black ralph lauren
every time i get out they put me right back in
the michael corleone of the microphone
the michelangelo of flow i paint pictures with poems
i gather no moss like a rolling stone
case the grim reaper visits my home nigga im gone cmon
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
tote more guns then roses foes is 
visibly shook of the invisible bully lets go
flowers need water to grow it gotta rain
and in order to experience joy you need pain
every time a baby is born somebodys slain
you know the saying somebodys lose is anothers gain
the sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
a rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
everything evens up you just wait
even a garbage can gets a steak
you aint even a garbage can you have faith
but when it turns your way before it turns away
gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from jay
you will get return in your investment if attention you pay lets go
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
life is all about guns and roses  im not trying to be no big thing no no
you gotta let this one breathe just
just let it breathe for a second
  im not trying to give you no advice

uhh uhh yea
first they love me then they hate me then they love me again
 they love me again
lets take a trip down i gotcha
lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetary
rain grey skies seems at the end of every
young black life is this line damn  him already
such a good kid got us pourin henn already
liquor to the curb for my niggaz up above
when it cracks through the pavement thats my way of sendin love
so give big a hug tell aaliyah i said hi
til the next time i see her on the other side
he was just some thug that caught some slugs
and we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
he walked like ussss talked like ussss
his back against the wall nigga fought like us  damn
poor isis thats his momma name
momma aint strong enough to raise no boy whats his father name
shorty never knew him though he had his blood in him
hot temper momma said he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with him so the streets raised him
isis blamin herself she wish she coulda saved him
damn near impossible only men can raise men
he was his own man not even him can save him
he put his faith in a thirtyeight in his waist
but when you live by the gun you die by the same fate
end up dead before thirtyeight and umm
thats the life of us raised by winter its a cold world
old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
isis life just ended on that rainy day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed
down at the city morgue opened the drawer saw him nude
her addiction grew prescription drugs shift and brew
angel dust dipped in woo
she slipped into her own fantasy world
had herself pregnant by a different dude
but reality bites and this is her life
he wasnt really her husband though he called her wife
it was just this night when moon was full
and the stars were just right and the dress was real tight
had her soundin like lisa lisa  i wonder if i take you home
will you still love me after this night
mike was the hardhead from the around the way
that she wanted all her life shit she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
he was a willie all her life he wasnt really the one to like
it was a dude named shy who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but isis liked this broadway life
she loved the gucci sneakers the red green and whites
hangin out the window when she first seen him fight
she was so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight that
turned into a homicide thatll alter their life
see mike at thirtytwo was still on the scene
had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
sure he saw him as an infant but he dissed on him like
if that was my son he would look much different
see im lightskinnded and that baby theres dark
so its mommas baby poppas maybe
mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets 
had his old reliable thirtyeight gun in his reach
its been fourteen years him and isis aint speak
he runnin around like lifes a peach til one day
he approached this thug that had a mean mug
and it looked so familiar that he called him young cuz
told him get off the strip but the boy aint budge 
instead he pulled out a newer thirtyeight snub
he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused 
there was somethin in this mans face he knew he seen before
its like lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature
and he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
you know what they say about he who hesitates in war
 he who hesitates is lost
he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank
the old man didnt think he just followed his instinct
six shots into his kid out of the gun
niggaz be a father youre killin your son
six shots into his kid out of the gun
niggaz be a father you killin your sons
meet the parents  send correction to this typist
 some how some way

young hov bout to go to the range
bout to work on perfecting my aimshawn carter was born december th
weighing in at ten pounds eight ounces
he was the last of my four children
the only one who didnt give me any pain when i gave birth to him
and thats how i knew that he was a special child
hi baby whats wrong  you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me is it something that ive done again
 you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me
they say they never really miss you til you dead or you gone
so on that note im leavin after this song
see you aint gotta feel no way about jay so long
at least let me tell you why im this way hold on
i was conceived by gloria carter and adnus reeves
who made love under the sycamore tree
which makes me a more sicker mc and my momma would claim
at ten pounds when i was born i didnt give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare i made up for birth when i got here
she knows my purpose wasnt hurt cause i aint perfect i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasnt matchin my gear
now im just scratchin the surface cause whats buried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
i went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
hold on
shawn was a very shy child growing up
he was into sports and a funny story is
at four he taught himself how to ride a bike
a twowheel at that isnt that special
but i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up
now all the teachers couldnt reach me and my momma couldnt beat me
hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me so
with that disdain in my membrane
got on my pimp game fuck the world my defense came
then dehaven introduced me to the game
spanish jose introduced me to caine im a hustler now
my gear is in and im in the incrowd
and all the wavy lightskinned girls is lovin me now
my selfesteem went through the roof man i got my swag
got a vocal from this girl when her man got bagged
plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had
supposedly  knowin nobody paid jaz whack ass
im gettin ahead of myself by the way i could rap
that came second to me movin this crack
give me a second i swear i would say about my rap career
til ninetysix came niggaz im here  goodbye
  talking
shawn used to be in the kitchen beating on the table and rapping 
and umm into the wee hours of the morning
and then i brought him a boombox
and his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts 
but that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble
goodbye to the game all the spoils the adrenaline rush
your blood boils you in a spot knowin cops could rush
at you in the drop you so easy to touch
no two days are alike except the st and th pretty much
and trust is a word you seldom hear from us
hustlers we dont sleep we rest one eye up
and a drought could define a man when the well dries up
you learn the worth of water
without work you thirst til you die  yup
and niggaz get tied up for product
and little brothers ring fingers get cut up
to show mothers they really got em
and this is the stress i lived with
til i decided to try this rap shit for a livin
i pray im forgiven  for every bad decision i made
every sister i played  cause im still paranoid to this day
and its nobody fault i made the decisions ive made
this is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me

if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black

 of history in the making during our generation

 i did not come here to show out did not come here to impress you
 because to tell you the truth when i leave here im gone
 and i dont care what you think about me  but just remember

 twenty years from now youll never be able to say
 that these brothers lied to you jack

im like che guevara with bling on im complex
i never claimed to have wings on
nigga i get mine  by any means on whenever theres a drought
get your umbrellas out because thats when i brainstorm
you can blame shawn but i aint invent the game
i just rolled the dice tryin to get some change
and i do it twice aint no sense in me
lyin as if i am a different man
and i could blame my environment but
there aint no reason why i be buyin expensive chains
hope you dont think users are the only abusers
niggaz gettin high within the game

im ten years removed still the vibe is in my veins
i got a hustler spirit nigga period

foolish pride is what held me together through the years
i wasnt felt which is why i aint never played myself

fore you knock the war try to put your dogs in it

the black album second verse is like
devils pie save some dessert for us

these cowards gonna make a nigga right uhh
they wont be happy til somebody die uhh
oh man i gotta get my soul right uhh
fore im locked up for my whole life uhh
every time it seems its alright
somebody want they soul to rise
i chase you off of this earth
let me get serious for yall one second
i got dreams of holdin a nine milla to bobs killer
askin him why as my eyes fill up
these days i cant wake up with a dry pillow
gone but not forgotten homes i still feel you
so curse the day that birthed the bastard
who caused your church mass reverts to crash
the first to blast then reverse the curse
the first to date and there you are bobalob
lord forgive him we all have sinned
but bobs a good dude please let him in
and if you feel in my heart that i long for revenge
please blame it on the son of the mornin thanks againyoung  for life
once again its the life yessss
its intoxicatin man yall dont know why you do what you do
the allure of breakin the law
is always too much for me to ever ignore
i gotta thing for them big body benzes it dulls my senses
in love with a vdub engine
man im high off life fuck it im wasted
bathing ape kicks audemar piguet wrists
my women friend get tennis bracelets
trips to venice get they winters replaced with
the sun it aint even fun no more im jaded
man its just a game i just play it to play it
i put my feet in the footprints left to me
without sayin a word the ghettos got a mental telepathy
man my brother hustled so naturally
up next is me but what perplexes me
shit i know how this movie ends still i play
the starrin role in hovitos way
its just life i solemnly swear
to change my approach stop shavin coke
stay away from hoes put down the toast
cause i be doin the most oh no
but every time i felt that was that it called me right back
it called me right back man it called me right back  oh no
im like a russian mobster drinkin distilled vodka
til im under the field with hoffa its real
peel the top up like a toupee
mix the water with the soda
turn the pot up make a souflee
all of yall can get it like groupays in your way
im livin proof that crime do pay
say hooray to the bad guy and all the broads
puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game
puttin caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
all in the name of love
just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
over the house to take back everything that they claimed
or even the worst pain is the distress
learnin youre the mistress only after that love gets slain
and the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
now it gets tough to ever love again
but the allure of the game keeps callin your name
to all the allurists of the world i feel your pain
to all the christies in every cities and tiffany lanes
we all hustlers in love with the same thang
i never felt more alive than ridin shotgun
in clines green  until the cops pulled guns
and i tried to smoke weed to give me the fix i need
what the game did to my pulse with no results
and you can treat your nose and still wont come close
the game is a lightbulb with eleventymillion volts
and im just a moth addicted to the floss
and doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
by any means necessary whatever the cost
even if it means lives is lost
and i cant explain why i just love to get high
drink life smoke the blueberry sky blink twice
im in the blueberry  you blink three times
i may not even be alive
i mean james dean couldnt escape the allure
dyin young leavin a good lookin corpse
of course
once again its the life
i said its the life
once again its the life  oh no
 why i 
get so  uhhuh
hahahahahahaha  wooim just tryin to stay above water yknow
just stay busy stay workin
puff told me like the key to this joint
the key to staying on top of things
is treat everything like its your first project knahmsayin
like its your first day like back when you was an intern
like thats how you try to treat things like just stay hungry
uhh uhh yes yes
yall wanna know why he dont stop
yall wanna know why he dont flop
let me tell you peeople why
came from the bottom of the block i
when i was born it was sworn i was never gon be shit
had to pull the opposite out this bitch
had to get my riide on
eyes on the prize shawn knew i had to
had to had to get these chips
had to make moves like olajuwon
started out sellin dimes and nicks
graduated to a brick
no exaggeration my infatuation with the strip
legendary like a schoolboy
crushin merely nearly every every chick
heavy shit  thats how schoolboy got whipped
and got left on some just me myself and i
on some trugoy shit
had your boys threw place up to a place of no return
had to play with fire and get burned
only way the boy ever gon learn
had to lay way in the cut til i finally got my turn
now im on top in the spot that i earned
its my life  its my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
its my everything
like i never rode in a limo
like i just dropped flows to a demo
like its ninetytwo again and
and i got os in the rental
back in the stu again no prob livin was a whole lot simpler
when you think back you thought that
you would never make it this far then you
take advantage of the luck you handed
or the talent you been given
aint no half steppin aint no no slippin
aint no different from a block thats hidden
gotta get it while the gettings good
gotta strike while the irons hot fore you stop
then you gotta bid it good riddance
goodbye this is my second major breakup
my first was with a pager
with a hooptie a cookpot and the caine
this ones with the stool with the stage with the fortune
maybe not the fortune but certainly the fame
its my life  my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me
its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst like the first song i sang
woo its like the blues  we gon ride out on this one

i never wanted to be a thugfather

whatever guillotine guides my life
dear lord dont let me die tonight
but if i shall before i wake what shall i say
its been a good run from hoodlum to island estates

cause i believe within youre the reason that im still here
even though i dont act like it
even though i hear my calling and fight it
fools do me so wrong its hard to stay righteous
if pimping was a mountain to heaven id hike it
believe me lord i want you

sometimes i dont like who i am
when i look in the mirror my reflection is uncle sam
and every night i have these weird dreams

whatever guillotine guides my life
dear lord dont let me die tonight
but if i shall before i wake id accept my fate
i did what i did my heart was in the right place
i did so i could live to put food on my plate
you musta loved me not to let it end by  that day
well whatever the case im glad it wasnt murder
in a town you never hearda from a nickelplated burner

young scrappy thats what grown man do lets move
in this arena arena
all we wanna see is them hands up hands up
this is for them hustlin boys and girls
its the return of best of both worlds
well once upon a time they left the glove and the star kid
he swore he was the man but he was nothing but garbage
let me rephrase that bubblin with pride
did have skills but he was ugly inside
instead of uplift folks sittin on the non sense
hurtin people feelings like he didnt have a conscience
like i love you when hes hittin that stash
then degraded the shorty like he didnt have class
even let a gay jew man tack his jheri
then got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy
swindlin forgot the god above him
finally fan base trinklin down to nothing
no concern for his estate though was yearnin for a break
bitter and evil didnt learn from his mistake
the moral of the story is dont be a pair of knickers
be good boys and girls and you can be as great as
rick is
my baby mommas robe my rent is overdue
it took half the pay and now my life is filled with rainy days
but i stashed some dough how much youll ever know

i aint a bitch but i gotta divorce them
hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
and i aint even want to be famous
niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
and i aint even know how it came to this

the worst drug known to man
its stronger than heroin

sorry im a champion sorry im a champion

i dont think its meant to be be
but she loves her work more than she does me
and honestly at twentythree
i would probably love my work more than i did she
so we aint we
its me and her
cause what she prefers over me is work
and thats where we differ
so i have to give her
free time even if it hurts
so breathe mami its deserved
youve been put on this earth to be
all you can be like the reserves
and me my time in the army its served
so i have to allow she her time to serve
the times now for her
in time shell mature
and maybe we can be we again like we were

lose one let go to get one
left one lose some to win some

life is but a dream to me
i dont wanna wake up
thirty odd years without having my cake up
so im about my paper
  in a leap year
i dont know why we here
since we gotta be here
life is but a beach chair
went from having shabby clothes
crossing over abbey roads
hear my angels singing to me
are you happy hov
i just hope im hearing right
karmas got me feearing life
colleek are you praying for me
i got deamons in my past
so i got daughters on the way
if the prophecys correct
then the child should have to pay
for the since of a father
so i barter my tommorows
against my yesterdays
in hopes that shell be ok
and when im no longere here
the shade of face from the flare
ill give her my share of carols daughter
and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave 
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave
life is but a dream to me
gun shots sing to these
other guys but lullabys
dont mean a ting to me
im not afraid of dyng
im afraid of not trying
everyday hit every wave
like im hawaiian
i dont surf the net
no i never been on myspace
too busy letting my voice vibrate
carving out my space
in this world of fly girls
cutthroats   diamond cut ropes i twirls
benzs round corners
where the sun dont shine
i let the wheels give a glimpse
of hope of ones grind
some said hov how you get so fly
i said from not being afraid to fall out the sky
my physicals shell
so when i say farewell
my soul will find an even
higher plane to dwell
so fly you shall
so have no fear just know that
life is but a beach chair
life is but a dream cant mimic my life
im the thinnest cut slice
intercut the winners cup
with winters rough enough
to interrupt life
thats why im both
the saint  the sinner
nice
this is jay everyday
no compromise
no compass comes with this life
just eyes
so to map it out
you must look inside
sure books can guid you
but your heart defines you
chica
you corason is what brought us home
in great shape like heidi klum
maricon i am on
permanent vaca
life is but a beach chair
this song is like a hallmark card
until you read each here
so till shes here
and she declaired
the aire
i will be prepared
a blueprint for you to print
a map so you can back
a guide for your eyes
and so you wont lose scent
ill make a stink for you to think
i ink these verses full of prose
so you wont get connect out of  cent
my last will and testament i leave my heir
my share of rocafella records and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing deliver me from my enemies oh god
defend me from all that rise up against me
deliver me from the work of inequity
and save me from the bloody mary
look mind state of a gangster from the s
meets the business mind of motowns berry gordy
turned crack rock into a chain of s
sorry my jewelry is so gaudy
slid into the party with my new pair of mauris
america meet the gangster shawn corey
hey young world wanna hear a story
close your eyes and you can pretend youre me
im cut from the cloth of the kennedys
frank sinatra havin dinner with the genovese
this is the genesis of a nemesis
mother americas not witnessed since
the harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
this is the tale of lost innocence
as the incense burns and the turntables turn
and that al green plays
i see my mothers afro
as mama taps her toes as she rolls her js
and my papa just left the house
in search of the killer of my uncle ray
and shes trying to calm her nerves
as i observe this is just one day
and what tomorrow has in store
we can never be sure so all we can do is pray
because of your strength
while i walk the pond of eden
for god is my deep fix 
as i head to my homeroom
i observe the ruins
dope needles on the ground
i hear a car go vroom
drug dealer in the bm with the top down
as the girls start to giggle
i ask why you laugh
they say youre too little
one day youll understand
when you become a man
bout things you have to get you
fast forward freeze frame on my pistol fistful of dollars
ignorance is so blissful
i aint choose this life this life chose me
around here its the shit that you just do
i just left school
the same bm is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
they had their guns drawn
screaming just move
or is there something else you suggest we can do
he made his way to the trunk
opened it like huh
a treasure chest was removed
cops said hell be back next month
what we called corrupt he calls payin dues
now when the rules is blurred
as they is and were
what am i to do but pray
pray the lord forgive me
pray he guides me by for what im bout to go through pray
 
deliver me in thy righteousness
and cause me to escape
and climb thine air internal
save me thine lord 
geah anywhere theres oppression
the drug profession
flourishes like beverages
refreshing ahhh sweet taste of sin
everything i seen made me everything i am
bad drug dealer or victim i beg
what came first 
moving chickens or the egg
this i why i be so fresh
im trying to beat life cause i cant cheat death
treat shame with shamelessness
and stainless at anuses
you know the game this is
move coke like pepsi
dont matter what the brand name is
i stand behind mine
everything i do im a man behind mine
im not an angel im sure
but every night before i lay
i drop my knees to the floor and i pray
the name shall endure forever
the name shall be continued as long as the sun 
men shall be blessed in him
all nations shall call him blessed
in your name i pray 
lord bless usdreamed of you this morning
then came the dawn and
i thought you were here with me

back of johnnys album cover red and blue gucci shit
aint nothin changed but the year it is
i think i have to send you a reminder here it isyeah  in the morning on the westside highway top down baby
yeah the motivation for me 
was them tellin me what i couldnt be oh well
hey hey ohh hey hey
hey hey 
hey hey
blueprint  shit this the blueprint baby
uh yeah ay this a special dedication 
i wanna thank you for the fuel no really thank you
 hehehe
i felt so inspired by what my teacher said
said id either be dead or be a reefer head
now sure if thats how adults should speak to kids
especially when the only thing i did was speak in class  ill teach his ass
even betters what my uncle did
i popped my demo tape in started to beat my head
peaked out my eye see if he was beatin his
he might as well say beat it kid hes on the list
its like im searchin for kicks like a sneaker head
he gon keep pushin me until i reach the ledge
and when i reach the ledge ill tell em all to eat a dick
take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread spread spread
the motivation for me 
was them tellin me what i could not be oh well
hey hey
im so ambitious  i might hit two sisters 
hey im on a mission  no matter what the conditions 
forget the personal issues  when you been what i been through 
hey if you believe it  then you could conceive it 
yeah yeah yeah
i had to lace up my boots even harder
father is too far away to father furthermore all the 
kids either smoke reefer or either 
move white theres few writers in my cypher
so they made light of my type of
dreams seem dumb they said wise up
how many guysa you see makin it from here
the world dont like us is that not clear alright but
im different i cant base what im gon be
offa what everybody isnt they dont listen
just whisperin behind my back
no vision lack of ambition so whack
had a couple of meetings no offers yet
maybe i aint good enough for these offices
back to the drawin board duckin officers
its all good cause the streets is arin this
so with or without any of your involvement
we comin for all of this respect my conglomerate
i went from pauper to the president
every deal i made set precedent
niggas thought id fall without old buddy
oh buddy what i do is make more money
dear teacher your probably somewhere near a speaker
im ballin outta control can you hear my sneakers
fuck yall
the motivation for me
was them tellin me what i could not belets dance in style lets dance for a while
heaven can wait were only watchin the skies
hopin for the best but expecting the worst
are you gonna drop the bomb or not
let us die young or let us live forever
we dont have the power but we never say never
sitting in a sand pit life is a short trip
the musics full of sad men
forever young i wanna be forever young
do you really want to live forever forever and ever
forever young i wanna be forever young 
do you really want to live forever forever forever young
uhh young
ay may the best of your todays
be the worst of your tomorrows
but we aint even thinkin that far
knahmean
so we livin like a video 
where the sun is always out and you never get old
and the champagnes always cold and the musics always good
and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
and they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that prettyass car
without a wrinkle in today cause theres no tomorrow
just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
and it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
so lets just stay in the moment smoke some weed drink some wine
reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
leave a mark they cant erase neither space nor time
so when the director yells cut ill be fine
im forever young
fear not when or fear not why fear not much while were alive
life is for livin not livin uptight til you somewhere up in the sky
fear not die ill be alive for a million years byebye
so now for legends im forever young my name shall survive
through the darkest blocks over kitchen stoves over pyrex pots
my name shall be passed down to generations while debatin up in barbershops
young slung hung here show that the nigga from here
with a little ambition just what we can become here 
and as the father passed the story down to his sons ears
younger get younger every year yeah
so if you love me baby this is how you let me know
dont ever let me go thats how you let me know baby

and watch the hoes when they bump into your clothes
and i hope they shine

seems brainless on tours with whores thats what im saying i miss
cats that go all out for their gold plaques
starting out with four jacks ended up with gold acs

on the weight of me through you screw you
gun blew you i didnt want to choose you

its like i cant stop what im hearing within
its like the face inside is right
why does it look like night today

why am i so uptight today
paranoias all i got left
i dont know what stressed me first
or how the pressure was fed
but i know just what it feels like
to have a voice in the back of my head
its like a face that i hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time they lie
a face that laughs every time they fall
so you know that when its time to sink or swim
that the face inside is hearing me
right underneath my skin

as fate would have it jays status appears
to be at an alltime high perfect time to say goodbye

and i need you to remember one thing 
i came i saw i conquered
from record sales to sold out concerts
so muh if you want this encore
i need you to scream til your lungs get sore
tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
and every second i waste is more than i can taaaakkee
ive become so numb
i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
ive become so nuuuuummmbbb
ive become so nuuuummmmbb
so for one last time i need yall to roar
 one last time i need yall to roar jayz lyrics from ohhlacom originally

keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time 
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away and 
i didnt look out below
i watch the time go right out the window
trying to hold on and didnt even know
i wasted it all just to 
i kept everything inside and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when i tried so
scratches
  h to the izzo v to the izza

hey ma how you know niggaz wanna buy you
but see me i wanna fuck for free like akinyele
take this ride make you feel it inside your belly
if its tight get the ky jelly
all night get you wide up inside the telly
side to side til you say jayz youre too much for me
i am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints but i cant help the fact
that everybody can see these scars
i am what i want you to want what i want you to feel
but its like no matter what i do i cant convince you
to just believe this is real
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that im not

and now youre actin raw but you never had war
dont know how to carry your hoes wanna marry your hoe
now shes mad at me causer your majesty just happened to be
a pimp what a tragedy
she wanted us to end cause i fucked with friends
she gave me one more chance and i fucked her again
i seen her tears as she busted in i said shit
theres a draft shut the door bitch and come on in
i am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
cuz you dont understand i do what i can
sometimes i dont make sense
i am what you never wanna say but ive never had a doubt
its like no matter what i do i cant convince you for once just to hear me out
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do

ill be here cause youre all that ive got

if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
got em mike
hes got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure his caskets closed
rap critics that say hes money cash hoes
hes from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
if you grew up with holes in your zapatoes
youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
so fuck critics you can kiss the whole asshole
if you dont like the lyrics you can press fast forward
got beef with radio if we dont play they show
they dont play our hits  we dont give a shit so
all these mags try and use our ass
so advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
i dont know what you take us as
or understand the intelligence that jayz has
from rags to riches we aint dumb
we got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
 problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now the year is ninetyfour in my trunk is raw
in the rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
i got two choices yall pull over the car or 
bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor 
and i aint tryin to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
so i pull over to the side of the road i heard
  
cause im young and im black and my hats real low
or do i look like a mindreader sir  i dont know
am i under arrest or should i guess some mo
  well you was doin fiftyfive in the fiftyfour
  license and registration and step out of the car 
  are you carryin a weapon on you  i know a lot of you are
i aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
  
well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
  arent you sharp as a tack  you some type of
  lawyer or somethin somebody important or somethin
ha i aint passed the bar but i know a little bit
enough that you wont illegally search my shit
  
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
this is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
but a pussy havin no god damn sense try an push me
i try to ignore him talk to the lord
pray for him but some fools just love to perform
you know the type loud as a motorbike
but wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing thats gon happen is ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
and there i go trapped in the kitkat again
back through the system with the riffraff again
fiends on the floor scratchin again
paparazzis with they cameras snappin them
da try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mill for bail cause im african
all because this fool was harassin them
tryin to play the boy like hes saccharin
but aint nuttin sweet bout how i hold my gun
i got  problems b and a bitch aint one  hit me
shut up when im talkin to you
shut up shut up shut up
shut up when im talkin to you

but when i rap i come off like that without the glitches
never crossed the black cat with the riches
im leaving stevie sayin no wonder youre superstitious
beef im with it simple yall can all get it
yall dont all get it
dont nobody of mind for this matter
can gather the data until ya mind dont matter
i bubble like lather hustle like the leadoff batter
cause all that matters is the money til it aint funny
you feel me when the beast screams kill me
dont jerk me boy i rip it silly
ill let you rise of course but if you dont fall off on your own
emcees i cut off at the knees like shorts
it gets worst if you dont care for my sick thoughts like a nurse
with no known remedy im leaving boys and men on bended knee till the end of the road
i lie low forget this record shit with one sale
check it out
the nerve of these herbs
yall know which swerve from the curb in the lax
the best observe
im splashing splurging dashing thats my word ya know
champagne glass is crashing cant ration
used to having a whole lot so dough i blow a lot
had a buck fifty while you were still taking skibby to school
ran with one of them cats that hides tiffanys for them jewels
back when duke was jumping out of cabs in krush groove

dreaming alive but look what it got me

like the point guard off your favorite team without doubt
my life aint rosy but i roll with it
my mind was fine until the dough hit it and told me that the mo did it
and now its kosher shit is so hasidic
i blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but no bitches

tryin to strike a bargain hoping that they might get pardoned
shit im involved with got me pins and needles
and my cerebral bes the wickedess evil thoughts that this martyr feed you
feedback in the game so deep fiends could catch ya
freeze off my knee cap can yall believe that

my rise to riches surprised the bitches  think harder

now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours 
 history so long so long
so long so long
in search of victory she keeps saluting me
if only we can be together momentarily
we can make love and make history
why wont you visit me until she visit me
ill be stuck with her sister her name is defeat
she gives me agony so much agony
she brings me so much pain so much misery
like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
as the crowd screams for the other team
i practiced so hard for this moment victory dont leave
i know what this means im stuck in this routine
whole new different day the same old thing
all i got is dreams nobody else can see
nobody else believes nobody else but me
where are you victory i need you desperately
not just for the moment to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long 
 so long so long
so now im flirting with death 
hustling like a g while victory wasnt watching took chances repeatedly
as a teenage boy before acne before i got proactive i couldnt face she
i just threw on my hoody and headed to the street
i swear i met success we lived together shortly
now success was like lust shes good to the touch
shes good for the moment but shes never enough
everybodys had her shes nothing like v
but success is all i got unfortunately
but im burning down the block hoping in and out of v
but something tells me there is much more to see
before i get killed cause i cant get robbed
so before me success and death ménage
i gotta get lost i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battle finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long
so long so long
now victory is mine taste so sweet
shes my trophy wife your coming with me
well have a baby who stutters repeatedly
well name him history hell repeat after me
hes my legacy son of my hard work
future of my past thatll explain who ill be
rank me amongst the greats either one two or three
if i aint number one then ive failed you victory
aint in it for the fame that dies within weeks
aint in it for the money can take it when you leave
i want to be remembered long after you breathe
long after im gone long after i breathe
i leave all i am in the hands of history
thats my last will testimony
this is much more than a song its a baby shower 
ive been waiting for this hour history of ours
now that all the smoke is gone
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours
history so long so long
so long so longwhen the sky falls and the earth quakes
we gon put this back together
we wont break
sa pa sé my portauprinces
my haitian gods and all of my princesses
our condolences as you fightin against this
were right by your side as we tryin to make sense of this
heavenly father help us see through these problems
and for those that left accept them into your garden
so heres my theory the countrys already starvin
so we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
god please pardon i speak from the heart
its the only way i see this tragedy befall on them
so lets get involved with them hand to hand with them
arm to arm with them til they get strong again
when the sky falls
cant wait until tomorrow
haiti mon amour
haiti mon amour
not gonna leave you stranded alone alone
oh no
learn from the past new orleans was flooded
so we know we just cant rely on the government
we under the rubble again here we go rumbling when
when we gon catch a break my friend lost his mother and then
and then carline lost her uncles and them
buried with no caskets they just put covers on them
and the tears fall and we fight back
story aint done it cant end like that
nah not like this tomorrows survivors gonna carry on your name
you live on inside us your memorys alive with us
you inspired us to rebuild this country you just guide us
its not the angels that are on their way
its not the bells of santa trinite
the people waiting positions vacant
for hands to help not just to pray
haïti va sélever
tu vas te relever

transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch and then you die
but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but 
makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
we paid the price the circle of success they turned my mic up

if every nigga in your clique is rich yo clique is rugged
nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches
i hope you fools choose to listen i drop jewels bust it
these are the rules i follow in my life you gotta love it
jiggy jigga lookin gully in the joint 
if yall niggas aint talkin bout large money whats the point

but these mills well they make me hot  yall dont feel me
enough to stop the illin right
but at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
im so confused okay im gettin weeded now
i know i contradicted myself look i dont need that now 
its just once in a blue and its nothin to do and
the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through

i freed my mind sometimes i here myself moanin
take one more toke then i leave that weed alone man
it got me goin shit
  repeat xthis shit is wicked on these mean streets
none of my friends speak
were all trying to win but then again
maybe its for the best though cause when theyre seeing too much
you know theyre trying to get you touched
whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldnt understand the mechanics
and the workings of the underworld granted
nine to five is how to survive i aint trying to survive
im trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
life ills poison my body
i used to say fuck mic skills
and never prayed to god i prayed to gotti
thats right its wicked thats life i live it
aint asking for forgiveness for my sins ends
i break bread with the late heads picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the gamell do
it gets dangerous money and power is changing us
and now were lethal infected with devils
we used to fight for building blocks
now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
the closest of friends when we first started
but grew apart as the money grew and soon grew blackhearted
thinkin back when we first learned to use rubbers
he never learned so in turn im kidnappin his babys mother
my hand around her collar feeding her cheese
she said the taste of dollars was shitty so i fed her fifties
about his whereabouts i wasnt convinced
so i kept feedin her money til her shit started to make sense
who could ever foresee we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
now im tryin to rock this bitch to sleep
all the years we were real close
now i see his fears through her tears
know shes wishin we were still close
dont cry it is to be
in time ill take away your miseries and make em mine devils
my flesh no nigga could test
my soul is possessed by devils in the form of diamonds and lexuses
the exorcist got me doing skits like homie
you dont know me but the whole world owe me  strip
was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
so now im down for whatever aint nothing nice
throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
but now this higher learning got the remy in me
liquors invaded my kidneys
got me ready to lick off mama forgive me
i cant be held accountable devils beatin me down boo
got me runnin with guys making gs tellin lies that sound true
come test me i never cower
for the love of money son im giving lead showers

look if i shoot you im brainless
but if you shoot me then youre famous  whats a ngga to do
when the streets is watching blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it thats the fastest way to get extorted
but my time is money at twentyfive i cant afford it
beef is sorted like godiva chocolates
nggaz you bought it i pull the slide back and cock it
plan aborted you and your mans get a pass
this rhyme youre operating on fck time
yall nggaz aint worth my shells all yall nggaz
tryin to do is hurt my sales and stop trips to john mcnale
the type to start a beef then run to the cops
when i see you in the street got one in the drop
when id rather be on tour gettin a hundred a pop
taking pictures with some btches in front of the drop
the streets is watching
when the streets is watching
blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it
now its hard not to kill nggaz
its like a full time job not to kill nggaz cant chill
the streets is watchin when you froze your arms
nggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm
cant get caught with your feet up gotta keep your heat up
sweet nggaz running round swearing sht is sweeter
once youre tagged lame the game is follow the leader
everybody want a piece of your scrilla so you gotta keep it realer
kidnap nggaz wanna steal ya
broke nggaz want no cash they just wanna kill ya
for the name nggaz dont know the rules
disrespectin the game want you to blow your cool
force your hand of course that mans plottin
smarten up the streets is watchin its on
my street mentality flip bricks forever know me and money
we like armed codefendants ngga we stick together
sht whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
hustle harder to see it if indictment time came around
and you can look up and down the streets and i cant be found
put in twentyfour hour shifts but that aint me now
got a face too easy to trace nggaz mouths got slow leaks
had to hide between my workers couldnt play those streets
she out of space like mercury you jerkin me  hectic
had to call upon my wolves to send nggaz the message
i said this lets play fair and we can stay here
im trying to transform you boyz ii men like daycare
hey theres money to be made and nggaz got the picture
stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
then hard times fell upon us half of my staff
had warrants the other half in the casket lay dormant
i felt like life was cheating me for the first time
in my life i was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me
was this a lesson god teaching me  was he saying that
im playing the game straight from hell from which few came back
like bad coke pimp or die was my mindframe bad
was nggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack
aint a whole lot of brain to that just trying to maintain a stack
and not collide like two trains thats on the same track         
but get my life together like the oars i bring back
in the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
got my transporter take it cross the border then stop
to set up shop with a quarter of rock  heres the plan
for three straight weeks nggaz slaughtered the block
but you know the game is lluted fcked up me and my dues
one drop can wipe a ngga out faster than the cops
and this unstable way of living just had to stop
half of my nggaz got time we done real things
by ninetyfour became the subject of half of yall nggaz rhymes
public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street
but thats the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets
the life and times of a demonic mind excited with crime
and the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
i figured sht why risk myself i just write it in rhymes
and let you feel me and if you dont like it then fine
the mindstate of a ngga who boosted the crime rate
so high in one city they send national guards to get me
ya dig
the streetsverse one
im done talking
ran up in the spot gun smoking
shot it in the air one woke him
sunsoaking sweating in his bed like dunlo
thinking to himself what done provoked him
his thoughts is racing like a vulcan
i swear i saw a lightbulb when
he finally figured out who was the culprit
i said yeah remember me from friend or foe when
i told you dont ever ever come around here no more
time to pay now you try to rise i wave the gun  lay down
this time youre really going to listen to jay now
i try to talk sensibly hoping that eventually you realize
i had this locked and it just wasnt meant to be
plus i had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
and it wasnt afterthought that maybe youll try to revenge me
but i was like nah chromes had to know he was wrong
and if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
plus you promised
and thats really no fun 
yeah i find you in this motel  with all these guns
and all your goons lined up in adjoining rooms
like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
but my minds like a flower in bloom
 my eyes just scower the room
im alert plus i paid the clerk i got it laid out
you think you the first nigga i played out in a  hotel town 
come on now i peep your lexus at you
left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
money well invested rudely interrupted
jamaican accents  
a gun in your face and thats all you can come up with
im done talking back up and clap them one in the abdomen 
do me a favor dude get  ice cubes i pass them
take that ice up for the nicest mc
and please yo tell big hes unbelievable 
friend or foe biotchhow can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in
theres gotta be them times youll be wrong nah mean
how can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga 
he never even met that he dont even know and shit
i think this rap shit is all beef
yall dont even know every day im livin with stress
got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
cant even enjoy myself at a party unless
im on the dance floor hot ass vest
you think im freakin these chicks right
itry not to brush against they chest

swear to everything when i leave this earth
its gon be on both feet never knees in the dirt
you could try me fucka but when i squeeze it hurts fine
well lose two lives yours and mines
gimme any amount of time dont let ms carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin tears on my sleeve
told the judge didnt budge it was him or me
and i aint trying to be hard but im guilty as charged
put my mercy on this court and my faith in god 
and pray hard none of my nephews wanna be starslucky me
chorus karen anderson
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
i hate all girls with alterior motives

niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
hate a nigga like that faggot get your own
hate that i cant roam the street without the clip and chrome

chorus karen anderson jayz
you only know what you see

and now that ive arrived
i see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold
nigga see you in the street pretend to be friendly
but i know any type of success breeds envy
i know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me
leave my friends in a circle pouring out henny
but gs is heaven bound so how im gon receive 
anything yall pour to the ground next time throw it up
and aint nothing changed so even in my afterlife i show it up
dont grieve for me my art remains
like a dart from the speaker to your heart
spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal
plan to leave without a fight i plant a seed i give life

just a breeze not enough to catch a real vibe
then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five
aint tryin to kill em at first just buildin clientele

but when demand grows its time to expand yo
you dont want no garbage papi its ten grand per blow fo sho

cuts and scratchesuhhuh jeje jejejeah 
yeyeyeah yeyeyeah
how real is this how real is this
uhhuh huh inspect this here check
verse one
im from where the hammers rung news cameras never come
you and your man houndin every verse in your rhyme
where the grams is slung niggas vanish every summer
where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can and run
where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
to achieve this goal quicker sold all my weight wet
faced with immeasurable odds still i get straight bets
so i felt some more something and you nothing check
i from the other side with other guys dont walk to much
and girls in the projects wouldnt fuck us if we talked too much
so they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
i dont know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us
im from where the beef is inevitable summertimes unforgetable
boosters in abundance buy a halfprice sweater new
your world was everything so everything you said youd do
you did it couldnt talk about it if you aint lived it
i from where niggas pull your car and argue all day about
whos the best mcs biggie jayz and nas
where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
at each others throats for the love of foreign cars
where cats catch cases hoping the judge r and rs
but most times find themselves locked up behind bars
im from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
im from marcy son just thought id remind yall
chorus 
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
mentally been many places but im brooklyns own
verse two
im from the place where the chruch is the flakiest
and niggas is praying to god so long that they atheist
where you cant put your vest away and say youll wear it tomorrow
cause the day after well be saying damn i was just with him yesterday
im a block away from hell not enough shots away from straight shells
an ounce away from a triple beam still using a handheld weight scale
your laughing you know the place well
where the liqour stores and the base well
and government fuck government niggas polotic themselves
where we call the cops the ateam
cause they hop out of vans and spray things
and life expectancy so low we making out wills at eightteen
where how you get rid of guys who step out of line your rep solidifies
so tell me when i rap you think i give a fuck who criticize
if the shit is lies god strike me
and i got a question are you forgiving guys who live just like me
well never know
one day i pray to you and said if i ever blow let em know
mistakes aint exactly what takes place in the ghetto
promise fulfilled but still i feel my job aint done
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
chorus 
verse three
im from where they crossover and clap boards
lost jehovah in place of rap lords listen
im up the block round the corner and down the street
from where the pimps prostitutes and the drug lords meet
we make a million off of beats cause our stories is deep
and fuck tomorrow as long as the night before was sweet
niggas get lost for weeks in the streets twisted off weed
and no matter the weather niggas know how to draw heat
whether your fourfeet or minute size it always starts out with
three dice and shoot the five
niggas thought they douce was live now hit em with trips
and i reached down for their money pa forget about this
this time around its platinum like the shit on my wrist
and this glock on my waist yall cant do shit about this
niggas will show you love thats how they fool thugs
before you know it your lying in a pool of blood
chorus kelly price 
talking throughout my life 
no matter what ive done
youve been merciful and your love endureth 
through all things  for that
i am eternally grateful
verse 
since my date of birth
bought you nothing but hurt
play those video games
stole change from ya purse
sat on the cold court bench
til i was arraigned in ya skirt
saw the pain in ya face
through you maintained a smirk
all you did was motivate me
dont let em hold you back
what i do i turned around
and i sold you crack
i was a bastard for that
still im drowning in shame
just remember one thing now
youre not to blame
you was newly seperated
tryin to escape ya world
and through my thirst
i didnt help you
i just made things worse
i hated me and everybody
that created crack
had me thinkin
the newest kicks and the latest gat
still havent apologized
so please play this back
while i try to come to terms
with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way
cocaine numbs the brain
all i did was think about
how the funds once came
then i ran across this memory 
and it stung the brain
how can you ever destroy the beauty
from which one came
thats a savage youre the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why i rhyme above average and
i aint shit
glad you got yourself together
no thanks to me
strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
you must love me
chorus  
say that you love me
all i know say that you must love me
ohh yeah
verse 
we used to fight every night
but i never would suffer
just smile my big brothers
tryna make me tougher
as we grew fussing and fighting continued
as i plundered through ya stuff
and snuck ya clothes to school
got intense real intense
as we got older
never believed it would lead
to be popped in one of ya shoulda
with my rings knew you had it
cause you took too long
as mickey andy and the girl that bought it looked on
huffin and puffin gun in my hand
told you step outside
hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
made our way down the steps
maybe you thought it was just a threat
or maybe ya life was just that crazy
and you was beggin for death
try to justify this in my young mind
but ya drillin it
and my ego hurt combined
drove me berzerk
saw the devil in your eyes
high off more than weed
confused i just closed
my young eyes and squeezed sorry boys
but all the money in the world couldnt bring me back again
lay down lay down
gonna stretch my mic out in ponce funeral home on marcy
all those new niggaz stop there
but a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
the last of the real hustlers well
maybe not the last
bleeks gonna be a good rapper
new improved jayz
i quit
im retirin
aint enough money in this game to keep me around

and see my own coffin feelin haunted ready to leave
this world that im lost in my only chance
to see the seeds i lost through abortion

inspect the game yo thats right
 last week i had everything
 i had the money had the cars the bitches
 and the jewelry
	and then my motherfuckin niggaz started snitchin
 beyotch
growin up in the hood just my dog and me
we used to hustle in the hood for all to see
problems i called on him he called on me
we wasnt quite partners i hit him off my p
met him unlocked doors off my keys
yeah we spoke much more than cordially
man he broke bread with me my business spread swiftly
the feds came to get me we both fled quickly
wasnt quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
got caught and thats when our relationship strayed
used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
and when he called collect and i heard his name
i quickly accepted but when i reached the phone
hes talkin reckless i can sense deceit in his tone
i said damn dawg what nine weeks and youre home
he said main man you think shits sweet cause youre home
i just sat spat no more speech in the phone
the crackers up there bleachin your dome youre reachin
i said the world dont stop ive got to keep keep on
from there i sensed the beef was on
i ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
to see if i had bugs and leeches on my phone
cant be too safe cause niggaz is twofaced
and they show the other side when they catch a new case
its on
it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i dont see how this side of you could be provoked
funny what seven days can change
a stand up nigga now you sit down to aim
used to have a firm grip now you droppin names
uhhuh uhhuh 
like i put the toast to your head and made you sell
we both came in this game blind as hell
i did a little better had more clientele
told you put away some cheddar now you cryin for bail
seventeen and im holdin on to around a mill
i could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill
had niggaz thinkin i was from uptown for real
i had so much hustle plus i was down to ill
like a brooklyn nigga straight out of brownsville
down and dirty down to fight the round thirty
freezin on them corners still holdin my crack
lookin up and down the block the fuck is the dough at
came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
you tell them feds i said im never goin back
im from marcy and marcy dont raise no rats
you know the consequences of your acts you cant be serious
the lawyer i retained you said you leakin some things
all this after a week in the bang
im mad at myself cause i didnt spot the weak and lame
i woulda bet the house you wouldnt speak a thang
nigga this was the oath to the top of broke
even pricked our finger anything that got between us
we sposed to cock the ninas what happened to that
instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
fuck it the same thing make you laugh make you cry
thats right the same game that make you mad could make you die
its a dice game and sometimes you crap
who woulda thought youd get popped one time and rap
now you know thats bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up like this is my dad
the labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
youll always be in jail nigga just minus the bars
shit is crazy man
all these niggaz out here snitchin
we was one step away from takin this crack money
and recyclin it through the ghettoes
and buildin back up our own hoods
now all you niggaz start snitchin on each other

i felt his hatred it was harsh fore this fakin shit start
i should take him in back of the building and blaze him
uhoh this nigga jay he aint slow he musta picked up on the vibe
and had i not been so high i woulda been able to hide
tried to cover up myself as i gave him a five
hugged him as if i loved him
to the naked eye
it woulda seemed we was the closest but to those that know us
could see that somethin was about to go down
stay focused
im tryin to concentrate but its like hes reading my mind
as if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
could he see i had plans on bein the man
ever since we first spoke and he put that g in my hand
and i gave it back to show him i was down for the cause
as he approached  and i paused

	this is  yall
	in new york city for the first day in the trial of 
	im gone 
	the state vs shawn carter aka jayz
	uhh uhhuhuh uhh uhhuhuh uhh
	whatever the verdict in this trial may be
	the effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide
aiyyo stand forward fore you take notice
or witness to me killin the track
testify til me spillin the smack
now they got me for traffickin racketeerin audio crack
	they call me dope man dope man
	i try to tell em im where hope floats man
	ghetto spokesman
a broke man approachin the bench with intent
to bury me under the cell fingered me as the toast man
evidence stemmin from ninetysix
they say the world aint recovered from his fix
while they was usin cut i was on some other shit
gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
nowaday the jury got they brow raised
listenin to testimony about my foul ways
exhibit a reasonable doubt
they say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
	you can feel the tension building here
	as an unprecedented number of people have turned out
	for what may be the trial of the century
how come you label your brand of dope
volume  and spread it through the slums
fed it to the young with total disregard
your honor the state seeks the maximum charge
and how could you turn right around
and release a lethal dosage called volume 
and is true you operate the criminal enterprise
known as rocafella in charge of his meteoric rise
and do you deny youre responsible for the demise
of record execs and do you object
your distributions polygram and through your connects
def jam you pushed over five million soundscan
and not to mention your cohorts and henchmen
dame biggs lyor kev and russell simmons
and we aint gon talk about murder inc
that just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
	the state is seeking the maximum penalty
	and with the overwhelming amount of evidence
	the das presented things arent looking good
	despite the grim outlook at this point
	the rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
	in the face of adversity
	jayz is taking the stand
right hand on the bible left hand in the air
before i spoke one word made sure my throat was clear
ahem im a prisoner of circumstance
frail nigga i couldnt much work with my hands
but my mind was strong i grew where you hold your blacks up
trap us expect us not to pick gats up
where you drop your cracks off by the mack trucks
destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
keep us spiralin goin backwards
at age nine saw my first hate crime
blindfolded expected to walk a straight line
mind molded taught to love you and hate mine
climbed over it at a early age jay shined
fuck the system at lady justice i blaze nine
your honor i no longer kill my people i raise mine
the soul of mumia in this modern day time
	while the jury is inside deliberating
	outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation
	well the verdict has just been announced not guilty
	it is complete pandemonium out here 
	people are cheering and hugging  there he is
	jayz is exiting the courtroom right now
	there is a swarm of cameras surrounding him 
	and people are just rushing up to him
	lets try and make our way over there jayz jayz

let me scream your name
i took ya outta jacobs in clusters
busters they wanted to rush us
love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
when you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
you can light up the whole room turning day from night
when the summertime is in and the tops are down
with you around my neck we lock the whole block down 
it took shortsleeves and loungin to understand
the reason they call you ice everybody freeze
aint a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
and that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
the direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
i used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
guess i was jealous that they was so next to you
so i devoted half my time to invest in you
the other half was spent on protecting you
cause you belong to me now sing ya song for me
cmon
chorus x
im often with you so they wonder bout the juice i got
i took you from the projects and an abusive pops
from the bottom to the top
the skateboard to the drop
from the nada to the prada

from the first time i put you round my neck and locked ya
it was then i knew everywhere i went youd follow
soon i spent every dolla you became my habit
other brothers vice was smoke mines was carats
the more checks i got the more i laced my crew
the rocks got bigger watch face got blue

i mean the thugs love ya when your girls best friend
chorus x
and the wedding band you love

or  you find a chick shit you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you round town like her man
shake hands make friends like its all innocent

do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothin i made somethin doin
what i do through and through and
i give you the news  with a twist its just his ghetto pointofview
the renegade you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture bring em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no hes not around  now how that sound to ya jot it down
i bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
i help them see they way through it  not you
cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth you lose your tie and your shirt
since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it with em a minute
cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference  theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict  like you didnt experiment
now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin dogooders  too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
 and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go  hes 
and im the sinister mr kissmyass its just the
 renegade  never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a renegade  never been afraid to talk
about anything  anything  renegade
 never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a  never been afraid to holler
about anything  anything 
i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
whatchu hollerin gotta pay rent bring dollars in
by the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
doorag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me  im awkward i box leftier often
my pops left me an orphan my momma wasnt home
could not stress to me i wasnt grown specially on nights
i brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor  thirty years my senior
my childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky
big i did it  multi before i die 
no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight
see im a poet to some a regular modern day shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatterbrained atheist
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter  a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see its easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water  no wonder they try to hold me under longer
im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube  motherfuckers hate to like you

we was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
mommas rent his young brothers clothes
my nephews food and with that i sqooze
 and with that i froze
now my life is frozen in time behind these iron poles
and this story is told for young soldiers

hold back my pride but reality is screamin

okay lets do this 
things just aint the same for gangsters
but im a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
all of these rap singers claimin they bangers
doin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin the game no home trainin or manners
i was doin this shit when you was shittin pampers
i was movin them grams fore you knew what a hand that hand was
duckin the vans radars the scanners
fore you knew what hard white to tame was
i was hittin the turnpike aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cuss aight with them hammers
i was prickin my finger fore you knew what a fam was
i had it laid out fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mill later now you understand us

in the game word to the hyphen in my name
j a y dash hoffa
the past present nigga the future proper
the holy trinity of hiphop is us
we give dre his props but thats where it stops
its the roc
i know you got your eyes on me
i feel you watchin me
but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you bedda off not lookin at all
  
  
  
  
im still on top of the game
still droppin flames still cock and aim
still at the top had the roc for the fame
over setbacks theres been a lot since i came
you seen it all how i got how i gained
the momentum when it dropped how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock they watched me reclaim
the streets they made a special spot for my name
dre haters wanna stop to my reign
but the music lives in me every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the mane
see the world chear for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs itll drive them insane
the eyes that i played
the best to emerge in the game is the watcher
im rated r my brain contains graphics thangs
it turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
its like watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
which means i can see the whole planet in the scene
cash is the topic the object a fatter pocket
some take the crack and chop it but those that havent got it
take away the added profit its catastrophic
i take the gat and cock it and ill sit back and watch it
these new york streets is ugly i keep it gully
the world is mine and cant nobody keep it from me
yo my neighborhood is never sunny
in the place where the number one cause of death is money
you can try copin
ive seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
im still alive and scopin
be another hundred years til my skies close in
and ima die with my eyes open the watcher uhh uhh uhh

mommas youngest and strongest survived summers like saunas
mastered a corner like deion in his uniform
pop hurtin assertive flirted with death
damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
grandmas favorite she could not understand
how theres people in the world who wouldnt want me as a neighbor
has to explain to her you think these folks want me in the penthouse
as a reminder that i make top paper
black entrepeneur nobody did us no favors
nobody gave us shit we made us
the rap pack im sinatra dames sam davis
bigs the smart one on the low like dean martin
we came in this game not beggin niggaz pardon
demandin yall respect hand over a check
and while yall at it hand over the jet
we the reason they aint hand over def jam so quick
they new every year i was droppin new product
i was raisin the stock up while buildin the roc up
but thats alright cause they knew they had to see us
when it was time for us to reup make us multimillionires
jejejeah
jeah  in my lifetime
i caught smaller cases but i had capital
hypocritic system let me right back at you
you better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
not even that scratches you specially if you black dude
they dont give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
and they can look good by paintin him as bad news
cause in my past i seen dudes get half of they views
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
so imagine how disturbed i was
when i seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
let me explain exactly how this shit was
this nigga un yo i scratched him he went home without an aspirin
but its cool cause hes back friends and halfinning is over
its in the past and im glad now im back to bein hova

helicopter seat feat inclined shit feelin like a sofa
helicopter meet me teta vero take me over
somewhere peaceful for the weekend now its back to speakin of vultures
so the next time that page six approaches us
heres a quote from jay nigga i did it my  waycan you hear me now  good

the blueprint birthed nigga i earthed you you cant be serious
young cause im thirtytwo dressed like im twentytwo
flow like a  do what i wanna do
goin on my th ring got phil jacksons and
flow is black magic im at it again
rose bowl with black karats horse  carriage to spend
like mason betha chasin this cheddar to the end
of the road because the end im told is nearer than we know
what can i say but live for today hov
yeah the blueprint  homey follow the moves
you put on two tube socks you couldnt walk in my shoes
i was dealt a bad hand fuck what else could i do
but keep somethin up my sleeve thatll help me through
but can you believe everywhere im at models come through
catfightin catwalkin it happens often
its true how society dont want me to move
into the penthouse building with spectacular views
theyre like uhh hes a menace he could never be a tenant
im like ooh whats a young nigga to do
i bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that i dont
give a fuck we just chillin watchin chandelier ceilings high as fuck
old lady dont blow my high
specially if you dont know my life dont make me bring
sharpton in it cause im darkskinneded or
dude with the fro and the rainbow coalition ima
victim of a single parent household born in a mousehole
mousetrap niggaz wanna know
how so how jay get up out that here yeah
i snatched purses i persevered yeah
i had work fiends purchased it was clear
i was out there sellin hope for despair but stop there
i swear i only make good from my mouth to gods ears
had to get out the hood
and i cant justify genocide
but i was born in the city where the skinny niggaz die
born in the city where the skinny niggaz ride
and as a skinny nigga i had beef with high size 
yeah its magic
uhh jayz and lenny kravitz
and its a heavy d production you bastards
come on
ha hey yo stop playin man
this is real serious
ha  yeah yo
 
lets go
post postatono hov hangin with bono
u can live like salvatore ferragamo
and u can cool out poolside at the delano
and u flow like you was out of your mind yo
cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from mcdonalds
would soon be the boss of the big apple ya know
and who knew dude that played ball for the nba
would make a mistake on the who knew estates throw it away
who knew that would be his last shot who drew up that play
they giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
but even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
you could have turned guns into roses like two times today
now heres something you gotta say two times to jay
i got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
got my boom box suntan lotion waiting for action
they say when you play with skills good luck could happen
lets go
 
 its the roc 
thats right
 
things got too hot so i jumped off in this rap shit
you got it kriskrossed aint no turning me backwards
too many district attorneys concerned with the actions
of one individual hes criminally attached
i turned in all my rap chips im earning my bachelors
while dating all the models and actresses
im learning all the potholes in every single barrio
trying not to mess up my axis kid
on the road to the riches through trafficking
through rappining and whatevers happening
rocawear im the young black ralph lauren
every time i get out they put me right back in
the michael corleone of the microphone
the michelangelo of flow i paint pictures with poems
i gather no moss like a rolling stone
case the grim reaper visits my home nigga im gone cmon
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
tote more guns then roses foes is 
visibly shook of the invisible bully lets go
flowers need water to grow it gotta rain
and in order to experience joy you need pain
every time a baby is born somebodys slain
you know the saying somebodys lose is anothers gain
the sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
a rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
everything evens up you just wait
even a garbage can gets a steak
you aint even a garbage can you have faith
but when it turns your way before it turns away
gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from jay
you will get return in your investment if attention you pay lets go
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
life is all about guns and roses  im not trying to be no big thing no no
you gotta let this one breathe just
just let it breathe for a second
  im not trying to give you no advice

its the gift  the curse
uhh uhh yea
first they love me then they hate me then they love me again
 they love me again
lets take a trip down i gotcha
lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetary
rain grey skies seems at the end of every
young black life is this line damn  him already
such a good kid got us pourin henn already
liquor to the curb for my niggaz up above
when it cracks through the pavement thats my way of sendin love
so give big a hug tell aaliyah i said hi
til the next time i see her on the other side
he was just some thug that caught some slugs
and we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
he walked like ussss talked like ussss
his back against the wall nigga fought like us  damn
poor isis thats his momma name
momma aint strong enough to raise no boy whats his father name
shorty never knew him though he had his blood in him
hot temper momma said he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with him so the streets raised him
isis blamin herself she wish she coulda saved him
damn near impossible only men can raise men
he was his own man not even him can save him
he put his faith in a thirtyeight in his waist
but when you live by the gun you die by the same fate
end up dead before thirtyeight and umm
thats the life of us raised by winter its a cold world
old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
isis life just ended on that rainy day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed
down at the city morgue opened the drawer saw him nude
her addiction grew prescription drugs shift and brew
angel dust dipped in woo
she slipped into her own fantasy world
had herself pregnant by a different dude
but reality bites and this is her life
he wasnt really her husband though he called her wife
it was just this night when moon was full
and the stars were just right and the dress was real tight
had her soundin like lisa lisa  i wonder if i take you home
will you still love me after this night
mike was the hardhead from the around the way
that she wanted all her life shit she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
he was a willie all her life he wasnt really the one to like
it was a dude named shy who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but isis liked this broadway life
she loved the gucci sneakers the red green and whites
hangin out the window when she first seen him fight
she was so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight that
turned into a homicide thatll alter their life
see mike at thirtytwo was still on the scene
had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
sure he saw him as an infant but he dissed on him like
if that was my son he would look much different
see im lightskinnded and that baby theres dark
so its mommas baby poppas maybe
mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets 
had his old reliable thirtyeight gun in his reach
its been fourteen years him and isis aint speak
he runnin around like lifes a peach til one day
he approached this thug that had a mean mug
and it looked so familiar that he called him young cuz
told him get off the strip but the boy aint budge 
instead he pulled out a newer thirtyeight snub
he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused 
there was somethin in this mans face he knew he seen before
its like lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature
and he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
you know what they say about he who hesitates in war
 he who hesitates is lost
he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank
the old man didnt think he just followed his instinct
six shots into his kid out of the gun
niggaz be a father youre killin your son
six shots into his kid out of the gun
niggaz be a father you killin your sons
meet the parents  send correction to this typist

since i will not lose they try to help him cheat
but i will not lose for even in defeat
theres a valuable lesson learned so it evens up for me

thank god man i had the block
yall hear me though
you young fucks got the game all wrong
this is my life man this aint no song

stop being a server get a meal yourself
where your heart at all that yickyack aint nobody scared of your gats

how many niggas done shot at me shivering
they were so scared they aint hit me once
young hov bout to go to the range
bout to work on perfecting my aimshawn carter was born december th
weighing in at ten pounds eight ounces
he was the last of my four children
the only one who didnt give me any pain when i gave birth to him
and thats how i knew that he was a special child
hi baby whats wrong  you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me is it something that ive done again
 you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me
they say they never really miss you til you dead or you gone
so on that note im leavin after this song
see you aint gotta feel no way about jay so long
at least let me tell you why im this way hold on
i was conceived by gloria carter and adnus reeves
who made love under the sycamore tree
which makes me a more sicker mc and my momma would claim
at ten pounds when i was born i didnt give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare i made up for birth when i got here
she knows my purpose wasnt hurt cause i aint perfect i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasnt matchin my gear
now im just scratchin the surface cause whats buried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
i went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
hold on
shawn was a very shy child growing up
he was into sports and a funny story is
at four he taught himself how to ride a bike
a twowheel at that isnt that special
but i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up
now all the teachers couldnt reach me and my momma couldnt beat me
hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me so
with that disdain in my membrane
got on my pimp game fuck the world my defense came
then dehaven introduced me to the game
spanish jose introduced me to caine im a hustler now
my gear is in and im in the incrowd
and all the wavy lightskinned girls is lovin me now
my selfesteem went through the roof man i got my swag
got a vocal from this girl when her man got bagged
plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had
supposedly  knowin nobody paid jaz whack ass
im gettin ahead of myself by the way i could rap
that came second to me movin this crack
give me a second i swear i would say about my rap career
til ninetysix came niggaz im here  goodbye
  talking
shawn used to be in the kitchen beating on the table and rapping 
and umm into the wee hours of the morning
and then i brought him a boombox
and his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts 
but that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble
goodbye to the game all the spoils the adrenaline rush
your blood boils you in a spot knowin cops could rush
at you in the drop you so easy to touch
no two days are alike except the st and th pretty much
and trust is a word you seldom hear from us
hustlers we dont sleep we rest one eye up
and a drought could define a man when the well dries up
you learn the worth of water

you can blame shawn but i aint invent the game
i just rolled the dice tryin to get some change
and i do it twice aint no sense in me
lyin as if i am a different man
and i could blame my environment but
there aint no reason why i be buyin expensive chains

trips to venice get they winters replaced with
the sun it aint even fun no more im jaded
man its just a game i just play it to play it
i put my feet in the footprints left to me
without sayin a word the ghettos got a mental telepathy
man my brother hustled so naturally
up next is me but what perplexes me
shit i know how this movie ends still i play
the starrin role in hovitos way
its just life i solemnly swear
to change my approach stop shavin coke
stay away from hoes put down the toast
cause i be doin the most oh no
but every time i felt that was that it called me right back
it called me right back man it called me right back  oh no
im like a russian mobster drinkin distilled vodka
til im under the field with hoffa its real
peel the top up like a toupee
mix the water with the soda
turn the pot up make a souflee
all of yall can get it like groupays in your way
im livin proof that crime do pay
say hooray to the bad guy and all the broads
puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game
puttin caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
all in the name of love
just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
over the house to take back everything that they claimed
or even the worst pain is the distress
learnin youre the mistress only after that love gets slain
and the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
now it gets tough to ever love again
but the allure of the game keeps callin your name
to all the allurists of the world i feel your pain
to all the christies in every cities and tiffany lanes
we all hustlers in love with the same thang
i never felt more alive than ridin shotgun
in clines green  until the cops pulled guns
and i tried to smoke weed to give me the fix i need
what the game did to my pulse with no results
and you can treat your nose and still wont come close
the game is a lightbulb with eleventymillion volts
and im just a moth addicted to the floss
and doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
by any means necessary whatever the cost
even if it means lives is lost
and i cant explain why i just love to get high
drink life smoke the blueberry sky blink twice
im in the blueberry  you blink three times
i may not even be alive
i mean james dean couldnt escape the allure
dyin young leavin a good lookin corpse
of course
once again its the life
i said its the life
once again its the life  oh no
 why i 
get so  uhhuh
hahahahahahaha  wooim just tryin to stay above water yknow
just stay busy stay workin
puff told me like the key to this joint
the key to staying on top of things
is treat everything like its your first project knahmsayin
like its your first day like back when you was an intern
like thats how you try to treat things like just stay hungry
uhh uhh yes yes
yall wanna know why he dont stop
yall wanna know why he dont flop
let me tell you peeople why
came from the bottom of the block i
when i was born it was sworn i was never gon be shit
had to pull the opposite out this bitch
had to get my riide on
eyes on the prize shawn knew i had to
had to had to get these chips
had to make moves like olajuwon
started out sellin dimes and nicks
graduated to a brick
no exaggeration my infatuation with the strip
legendary like a schoolboy
crushin merely nearly every every chick
heavy shit  thats how schoolboy got whipped
and got left on some just me myself and i
on some trugoy shit
had your boys threw place up to a place of no return
had to play with fire and get burned
only way the boy ever gon learn
had to lay way in the cut til i finally got my turn
now im on top in the spot that i earned
its my life  its my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
its my everything
like i never rode in a limo
like i just dropped flows to a demo
like its ninetytwo again and
and i got os in the rental
back in the stu again no prob livin was a whole lot simpler
when you think back you thought that
you would never make it this far then you
take advantage of the luck you handed
or the talent you been given
aint no half steppin aint no no slippin
aint no different from a block thats hidden
gotta get it while the gettings good
gotta strike while the irons hot fore you stop
then you gotta bid it good riddance
goodbye this is my second major breakup
my first was with a pager
with a hooptie a cookpot and the caine
this ones with the stool with the stage with the fortune
maybe not the fortune but certainly the fame
its my life  my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me
its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst like the first song i sang
woo its like the blues  we gon ride out on this one

i never wanted to be a thugfather
i only wanted to be a son of a father

sometimes i dont know what you want from me
but i do know you know what i want from you

whatever guillotine guides my life
dear lord dont let me die tonight
but if i shall before i wake what shall i say
its been a good run from hoodlum to island estates

if pimping was a mountain to heaven id hike it

sometimes i dont like who i am
when i look in the mirror my reflection is uncle sam
and every night i have these weird dreams

but if i shall before i wake id accept my fate
i did what i did my heart was in the right place
i did so i could live to put food on my plate
you musta loved me not to let it end by  that day

in a town you never hearda from a nickelplated burner

young scrappy thats what grown man do lets move
in this arena arena
all we wanna see is them hands up hands up
this is for them hustlin boys and girls
its the return of best of both worlds
well once upon a time they left the glove and the star kid
he swore he was the man but he was nothing but garbage
let me rephrase that bubblin with pride
did have skills but he was ugly inside
instead of uplift folks sittin on the non sense
hurtin people feelings like he didnt have a conscience
like i love you when hes hittin that stash
then degraded the shorty like he didnt have class
even let a gay jew man tack his jheri
then got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy
swindlin forgot the god above him
finally fan base trinklin down to nothing
no concern for his estate though was yearnin for a break
bitter and evil didnt learn from his mistake
the moral of the story is dont be a pair of knickers
be good boys and girls and you can be as great as
rick is
my baby mommas robe my rent is overdue
it took half the pay and now my life is filled with rainy days
but i stashed some dough how much youll ever know

shoulda stayed in food and beverage

too much sam rothstein
i aint a bitch but i gotta divorce them
hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
and i aint even want to be famous
niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
and i aint even know how it came to this

the worst drug known to man
its stronger than heroin

and honestly at twentythree
i would probably love my work more than i did she
so we aint we
its me and her
cause what she prefers over me is work
and thats where we differ
so i have to give her
free time even if it hurts
so breathe mami its deserved
youve been put on this earth to be
all you can be like the reserves
and me my time in the army its served
so i have to allow she her time to serve
the times now for her
in time shell mature
and maybe we can be we again like we were

life is but a dream to me
i dont wanna wake up
thirty odd years without having my cake up
so im about my paper
  in a leap year
i dont know why we here
since we gotta be here
life is but a beach chair
went from having shabby clothes
crossing over abbey roads
hear my angels singing to me
are you happy hov
i just hope im hearing right
karmas got me feearing life
colleek are you praying for me
i got deamons in my past
so i got daughters on the way
if the prophecys correct
then the child should have to pay
for the since of a father
so i barter my tommorows
against my yesterdays
in hopes that shell be ok
and when im no longere here
the shade of face from the flare
ill give her my share of carols daughter
and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave 
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave
life is but a dream to me
gun shots sing to these
other guys but lullabys
dont mean a ting to me
im not afraid of dyng
im afraid of not trying
everyday hit every wave
like im hawaiian
i dont surf the net
no i never been on myspace
too busy letting my voice vibrate
carving out my space
in this world of fly girls
cutthroats   diamond cut ropes i twirls
benzs round corners
where the sun dont shine
i let the wheels give a glimpse
of hope of ones grind
some said hov how you get so fly
i said from not being afraid to fall out the sky
my physicals shell
so when i say farewell
my soul will find an even
higher plane to dwell
so fly you shall
so have no fear just know that
life is but a beach chair
life is but a dream cant mimic my life
im the thinnest cut slice
intercut the winners cup
with winters rough enough
to interrupt life
thats why im both
the saint  the sinner
nice
this is jay everyday
no compromise
no compass comes with this life
just eyes
so to map it out
you must look inside
sure books can guid you
but your heart defines you
chica
you corason is what brought us home
in great shape like heidi klum
maricon i am on
permanent vaca
life is but a beach chair
this song is like a hallmark card
until you read each here
so till shes here
and she declaired
the aire
i will be prepared
a blueprint for you to print
a map so you can back
a guide for your eyes
and so you wont lose scent
ill make a stink for you to think
i ink these verses full of prose
so you wont get connect out of  cent
my last will and testament i leave my heir
my share of rocafella records and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing deliver me from my enemies oh god
defend me from all that rise up against me
deliver me from the work of inequity
and save me from the bloody mary
look mind state of a gangster from the s
meets the business mind of motowns berry gordy
turned crack rock into a chain of s
sorry my jewelry is so gaudy
slid into the party with my new pair of mauris
america meet the gangster shawn corey
hey young world wanna hear a story
close your eyes and you can pretend youre me
im cut from the cloth of the kennedys
frank sinatra havin dinner with the genovese
this is the genesis of a nemesis
mother americas not witnessed since
the harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
this is the tale of lost innocence
as the incense burns and the turntables turn
and that al green plays
i see my mothers afro
as mama taps her toes as she rolls her js
and my papa just left the house
in search of the killer of my uncle ray
and shes trying to calm her nerves
as i observe this is just one day
and what tomorrow has in store
we can never be sure so all we can do is pray
because of your strength
while i walk the pond of eden
for god is my deep fix 
as i head to my homeroom
i observe the ruins
dope needles on the ground
i hear a car go vroom
drug dealer in the bm with the top down
as the girls start to giggle
i ask why you laugh
they say youre too little
one day youll understand
when you become a man
bout things you have to get you
fast forward freeze frame on my pistol fistful of dollars
ignorance is so blissful
i aint choose this life this life chose me
around here its the shit that you just do
i just left school
the same bm is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
they had their guns drawn
screaming just move
or is there something else you suggest we can do
he made his way to the trunk
opened it like huh
a treasure chest was removed
cops said hell be back next month
what we called corrupt he calls payin dues
now when the rules is blurred
as they is and were
what am i to do but pray
pray the lord forgive me
pray he guides me by for what im bout to go through pray
 
deliver me in thy righteousness
and cause me to escape
and climb thine air internal
save me thine lord 
geah anywhere theres oppression
the drug profession
flourishes like beverages
refreshing ahhh sweet taste of sin
everything i seen made me everything i am
bad drug dealer or victim i beg
what came first 
moving chickens or the egg
this i why i be so fresh
im trying to beat life cause i cant cheat death
treat shame with shamelessness
and stainless at anuses
you know the game this is
move coke like pepsi
dont matter what the brand name is
i stand behind mine
everything i do im a man behind mine
im not an angel im sure
but every night before i lay
i drop my knees to the floor and i pray
the name shall endure forever
the name shall be continued as long as the sun 
men shall be blessed in him
all nations shall call him blessed
in your name i pray 
lord bless usdreamed of you this morning
then came the dawn and
i thought you were here with me

i think i have to send you a reminder here it isyeah  in the morning on the westside highway top down baby
yeah the motivation for me 
was them tellin me what i couldnt be oh well
hey hey ohh hey hey
hey hey 
hey hey
blueprint  shit this the blueprint baby
uh yeah ay this a special dedication 
i wanna thank you for the fuel no really thank you
 hehehe
i felt so inspired by what my teacher said
said id either be dead or be a reefer head
now sure if thats how adults should speak to kids
especially when the only thing i did was speak in class  ill teach his ass
even betters what my uncle did
i popped my demo tape in started to beat my head
peaked out my eye see if he was beatin his
he might as well say beat it kid hes on the list
its like im searchin for kicks like a sneaker head
he gon keep pushin me until i reach the ledge
and when i reach the ledge ill tell em all to eat a dick
take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread spread spread
the motivation for me 
was them tellin me what i could not be oh well
hey hey
im so ambitious  i might hit two sisters 
hey im on a mission  no matter what the conditions 
forget the personal issues  when you been what i been through 
hey if you believe it  then you could conceive it 
yeah yeah yeah
i had to lace up my boots even harder
father is too far away to father furthermore all the 
kids either smoke reefer or either 
move white theres few writers in my cypher
so they made light of my type of
dreams seem dumb they said wise up
how many guysa you see makin it from here
the world dont like us is that not clear alright but
im different i cant base what im gon be
offa what everybody isnt they dont listen
just whisperin behind my back
no vision lack of ambition so whack

back to the drawin board duckin officers
its all good cause the streets is arin this
so with or without any of your involvement

every deal i made set precedent
niggas thought id fall without old buddy
oh buddy what i do is make more money
dear teacher your probably somewhere near a speaker
im ballin outta control can you hear my sneakers

the motivation for me
was them tellin me what i could not belets dance in style lets dance for a while
heaven can wait were only watchin the skies
hopin for the best but expecting the worst
are you gonna drop the bomb or not
let us die young or let us live forever
we dont have the power but we never say never

forever young i wanna be forever young 
do you really want to live forever forever forever young

ay may the best of your todays
be the worst of your tomorrows

where the sun is always out and you never get old
and the champagnes always cold and the musics always good
and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
and they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that prettyass car
without a wrinkle in today cause theres no tomorrow
just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
and it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
so lets just stay in the moment smoke some weed drink some wine
reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
leave a mark they cant erase neither space nor time
so when the director yells cut ill be fine
im forever young
fear not when or fear not why fear not much while were alive
life is for livin not livin uptight til you somewhere up in the sky
fear not die ill be alive for a million years byebye
so now for legends im forever young my name shall survive
through the darkest blocks over kitchen stoves over pyrex pots
my name shall be passed down to generations while debatin up in barbershops
young slung hung here show that the nigga from here
with a little ambition just what we can become here 
and as the father passed the story down to his sons ears

feelin no remorse feelin like my hand was forced
middle finger to the law nigga grippin my balls
said the ladies they love me from the bleachers they screamin
all the ballers is bouncin they like the way i be leanin
all the rappers be hatin off the track that im makin
but all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
came from the bottom the bottom to the top of the pots
nigga london japan and im straight off the block
like a running back get it man im straight off the block
i can run it back nigga cause im straight with the roc
you gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
your homey hov in position in the kitchen with soda
i just whipped up a watch tryin to get me a rover
tryin to stretch out the coca like a wrestler yes sir

in case fiftytwo broads come out now you chillin
with a boss bitch of course sc on the sleeve
at the  club espn on the screen

and anywhere on my own cause i can see
the very worst part of you

on the low but the yacht got a triple deck
but when you young what the  you expect  yep yep

when you first come in the game they try to play you
then you drop a couple of hits look how they wave to you
from marcy to madison square
to the only thing that matters in just a matter of years 
as fate would have it jays status appears
to be at an alltime high perfect time to say goodbye
when i come back like jordan wearin the 
it aint to play games witchu
its to aim at you probably maim you
if i owe you im blowin you to smithereens
cocksucker take one for your team
and i need you to remember one thing 
i came i saw i conquered
from record sales to sold out concerts
so muh if you want this encore
i need you to scream til your lungs get sore
tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
and every second i waste is more than i can taaaakkee
ive become so numb
i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
ive become so nuuuuummmbbb
ive become so nuuuummmmbb
so for one last time i need yall to roar
 one last time i need yall to roar jayz lyrics from ohhlacom originally

it doesnt even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time 
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away and 
i didnt look out below
i watch the time go right out the window
trying to hold on and didnt even know
i wasted it all just to 
i kept everything inside and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when i tried so
scratches
  h to the izzo v to the izza

hey ma how you know niggaz wanna buy you
but see me i wanna fuck for free like akinyele
take this ride make you feel it inside your belly
if its tight get the ky jelly
all night get you wide up inside the telly
side to side til you say jayz youre too much for me
i am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints but i cant help the fact
that everybody can see these scars
i am what i want you to want what i want you to feel
but its like no matter what i do i cant convince you
to just believe this is real
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that im not
but ill be here cause youre all that ive got

rapidfire like im blastin a tec never jam though
never get high never run out of ammo
niggaz hatin the shit cause i slayed your bitch

and now youre actin raw but you never had war
dont know how to carry your hoes wanna marry your hoe
now shes mad at me causer your majesty just happened to be
a pimp what a tragedy
she wanted us to end cause i fucked with friends
she gave me one more chance and i fucked her again
i seen her tears as she busted in i said shit
theres a draft shut the door bitch and come on in
i am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
cuz you dont understand i do what i can
sometimes i dont make sense
i am what you never wanna say but ive never had a doubt
its like no matter what i do i cant convince you for once just to hear me out
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do
you face away and pretend that im not
ill be here cause youre all that ive got
i cant feel the way i did before

if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
got em mike
hes got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure his caskets closed
rap critics that say hes money cash hoes
hes from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
if you grew up with holes in your zapatoes
youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
so fuck critics you can kiss the whole asshole
if you dont like the lyrics you can press fast forward
got beef with radio if we dont play they show
they dont play our hits  we dont give a shit so
all these mags try and use our ass
so advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
i dont know what you take us as
or understand the intelligence that jayz has
from rags to riches we aint dumb
we got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
 problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now the year is ninetyfour in my trunk is raw
in the rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
i got two choices yall pull over the car or 
bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor 
and i aint tryin to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
so i pull over to the side of the road i heard
  
cause im young and im black and my hats real low
or do i look like a mindreader sir  i dont know
am i under arrest or should i guess some mo
  well you was doin fiftyfive in the fiftyfour
  license and registration and step out of the car 
  are you carryin a weapon on you  i know a lot of you are
i aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
  
well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
  arent you sharp as a tack  you some type of
  lawyer or somethin somebody important or somethin
ha i aint passed the bar but i know a little bit
enough that you wont illegally search my shit
  
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
this is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
but a pussy havin no god damn sense try an push me
i try to ignore him talk to the lord
pray for him but some fools just love to perform
you know the type loud as a motorbike
but wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing thats gon happen is ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
and there i go trapped in the kitkat again
back through the system with the riffraff again
fiends on the floor scratchin again
paparazzis with they cameras snappin them
da try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mill for bail cause im african
all because this fool was harassin them
tryin to play the boy like hes saccharin
but aint nuttin sweet bout how i hold my gun
i got  problems b and a bitch aint one  hit me
shut up when im talkin to you

never crossed the black cat with the riches
im leaving stevie sayin no wonder youre superstitious
beef im with it simple yall can all get it

i bubble like lather hustle like the leadoff batter
cause all that matters is the money til it aint funny
you feel me when the beast screams kill me
dont jerk me boy i rip it silly
ill let you rise of course but if you dont fall off on your own
emcees i cut off at the knees like shorts
it gets worst if you dont care for my sick thoughts like a nurse
with no known remedy im leaving boys and men on bended knee till the end of the road
i lie low forget this record shit with one sale
check it out
the nerve of these herbs
yall know which swerve from the curb in the lax
the best observe
im splashing splurging dashing thats my word ya know
champagne glass is crashing cant ration
used to having a whole lot so dough i blow a lot

like the point guard off your favorite team without doubt
my life aint rosy but i roll with it
my mind was fine until the dough hit it and told me that the mo did it
and now its kosher shit is so hasidic

tryin to strike a bargain hoping that they might get pardoned

and my cerebral bes the wickedess evil thoughts that this martyr feed you
feedback in the game so deep fiends could catch ya

now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours 
 history so long so long
so long so long
in search of victory she keeps saluting me
if only we can be together momentarily
we can make love and make history
why wont you visit me until she visit me
ill be stuck with her sister her name is defeat
she gives me agony so much agony
she brings me so much pain so much misery
like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
as the crowd screams for the other team
i practiced so hard for this moment victory dont leave
i know what this means im stuck in this routine
whole new different day the same old thing
all i got is dreams nobody else can see
nobody else believes nobody else but me
where are you victory i need you desperately
not just for the moment to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long 
 so long so long
so now im flirting with death 
hustling like a g while victory wasnt watching took chances repeatedly
as a teenage boy before acne before i got proactive i couldnt face she
i just threw on my hoody and headed to the street
i swear i met success we lived together shortly
now success was like lust shes good to the touch
shes good for the moment but shes never enough
everybodys had her shes nothing like v
but success is all i got unfortunately
but im burning down the block hoping in and out of v
but something tells me there is much more to see
before i get killed cause i cant get robbed
so before me success and death ménage
i gotta get lost i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battle finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long
so long so long
now victory is mine taste so sweet
shes my trophy wife your coming with me
well have a baby who stutters repeatedly
well name him history hell repeat after me
hes my legacy son of my hard work
future of my past thatll explain who ill be
rank me amongst the greats either one two or three
if i aint number one then ive failed you victory
aint in it for the fame that dies within weeks
aint in it for the money can take it when you leave
i want to be remembered long after you breathe
long after im gone long after i breathe
i leave all i am in the hands of history
thats my last will testimony
this is much more than a song its a baby shower 
ive been waiting for this hour history of ours
now that all the smoke is gone
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours
history so long so long
so long so longwhen the sky falls and the earth quakes
we gon put this back together
we wont break
sa pa sé my portauprinces
my haitian gods and all of my princesses
our condolences as you fightin against this
were right by your side as we tryin to make sense of this
heavenly father help us see through these problems
and for those that left accept them into your garden
so heres my theory the countrys already starvin
so we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
god please pardon i speak from the heart
its the only way i see this tragedy befall on them
so lets get involved with them hand to hand with them
arm to arm with them til they get strong again
when the sky falls
cant wait until tomorrow
haiti mon amour
haiti mon amour
not gonna leave you stranded alone alone
oh no
learn from the past new orleans was flooded
so we know we just cant rely on the government
we under the rubble again here we go rumbling when
when we gon catch a break my friend lost his mother and then
and then carline lost her uncles and them
buried with no caskets they just put covers on them
and the tears fall and we fight back
story aint done it cant end like that
nah not like this tomorrows survivors gonna carry on your name
you live on inside us your memorys alive with us
you inspired us to rebuild this country you just guide us
its not the angels that are on their way
its not the bells of santa trinite
the people waiting positions vacant
for hands to help not just to pray
haïti va sélever
tu vas te relever
nous nous éléverons
ensemble ensemble ensemble
we gon put this back together we wont break
we gon put this back together we wont break

hospital days reflectin when my man laid up
on the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up

yo still in all we livin just dream about the get back
that made him smile though his eyes said pray for me
ill do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully
murder is a tough thing to digest its a slow process
and i aint got nothin but time

transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch and then you die
but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but 
makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
we paid the price the circle of success they turned my mic up

if every nigga in your clique is rich yo clique is rugged
nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches
i hope you fools choose to listen i drop jewels bust it
these are the rules i follow in my life you gotta love it
jiggy jigga lookin gully in the joint 
if yall niggas aint talkin bout large money whats the point
even if it aint sunny hey i aint complainin

them dreams you say you got give me the chills
but these mills well they make me hot  yall dont feel me
enough to stop the illin right
but at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
im so confused okay im gettin weeded now
i know i contradicted myself look i dont need that now 
its just once in a blue and its nothin to do and
the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through

i freed my mind sometimes i here myself moanin
take one more toke then i leave that weed alone man
it got me goin shit
  repeat xthis shit is wicked on these mean streets
none of my friends speak
were all trying to win but then again
maybe its for the best though cause when theyre seeing too much
you know theyre trying to get you touched
whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldnt understand the mechanics
and the workings of the underworld granted
nine to five is how to survive i aint trying to survive
im trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
life ills poison my body
i used to say fuck mic skills
and never prayed to god i prayed to gotti
thats right its wicked thats life i live it
aint asking for forgiveness for my sins ends
i break bread with the late heads picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the gamell do
it gets dangerous money and power is changing us
and now were lethal infected with devils
we used to fight for building blocks
now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
the closest of friends when we first started
but grew apart as the money grew and soon grew blackhearted
thinkin back when we first learned to use rubbers
he never learned so in turn im kidnappin his babys mother
my hand around her collar feeding her cheese
she said the taste of dollars was shitty so i fed her fifties
about his whereabouts i wasnt convinced
so i kept feedin her money til her shit started to make sense
who could ever foresee we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
now im tryin to rock this bitch to sleep
all the years we were real close
now i see his fears through her tears
know shes wishin we were still close
dont cry it is to be
in time ill take away your miseries and make em mine devils
my flesh no nigga could test
my soul is possessed by devils in the form of diamonds and lexuses
the exorcist got me doing skits like homie
you dont know me but the whole world owe me  strip
was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
so now im down for whatever aint nothing nice
throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
but now this higher learning got the remy in me
liquors invaded my kidneys
got me ready to lick off mama forgive me
i cant be held accountable devils beatin me down boo
got me runnin with guys making gs tellin lies that sound true

make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
prayin my people bailed out like timewarner
awaitin call from his kin not the coroner
phone in my hand nervous confined to a corner
beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
how can i ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
this time stress givin this shit up fuck
chorus one
this is the number one rule for your set
in order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
on the rise to the top many drop dont forget
in order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
this is the number one rule for your set
in order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
and through our travels we get seperated never forget
in order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
as sure as this earth is turning souls burning
in search of higher learning turning in every direction seeking direction
my moms cryin cause her insides are dyin
her son tryin her patience keep her heart racin
a million beats a minute i know i push you to your limit
but its this game love im caught up all in it
they make it so you cant prevent it never give it
you gotta take it cant fake it i keep it authentic
my hand got this pistol shakin cause i sense danger
like camp crystal lake and
dont wanna shoot him but i got him trapped
within this infrared dot bout to hot him and hit rock bottom
no answers to these trick questions no time shit stressin

time waits for no man cant turn back the hands
once its too late gotta learn to live with regrets
chorus two

look if i shoot you im brainless
but if you shoot me then youre famous  whats a ngga to do
when the streets is watching blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it thats the fastest way to get extorted
but my time is money at twentyfive i cant afford it
beef is sorted like godiva chocolates
nggaz you bought it i pull the slide back and cock it
plan aborted you and your mans get a pass
this rhyme youre operating on fck time
yall nggaz aint worth my shells all yall nggaz
tryin to do is hurt my sales and stop trips to john mcnale
the type to start a beef then run to the cops
when i see you in the street got one in the drop
when id rather be on tour gettin a hundred a pop
taking pictures with some btches in front of the drop
the streets is watching
when the streets is watching
blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it
now its hard not to kill nggaz
its like a full time job not to kill nggaz cant chill
the streets is watchin when you froze your arms
nggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm
cant get caught with your feet up gotta keep your heat up
sweet nggaz running round swearing sht is sweeter
once youre tagged lame the game is follow the leader
everybody want a piece of your scrilla so you gotta keep it realer
kidnap nggaz wanna steal ya
broke nggaz want no cash they just wanna kill ya
for the name nggaz dont know the rules
disrespectin the game want you to blow your cool
force your hand of course that mans plottin
smarten up the streets is watchin its on
my street mentality flip bricks forever know me and money
we like armed codefendants ngga we stick together
sht whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
hustle harder to see it if indictment time came around
and you can look up and down the streets and i cant be found
put in twentyfour hour shifts but that aint me now
got a face too easy to trace nggaz mouths got slow leaks
had to hide between my workers couldnt play those streets
she out of space like mercury you jerkin me  hectic
had to call upon my wolves to send nggaz the message
i said this lets play fair and we can stay here
im trying to transform you boyz ii men like daycare
hey theres money to be made and nggaz got the picture
stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
then hard times fell upon us half of my staff
had warrants the other half in the casket lay dormant
i felt like life was cheating me for the first time
in my life i was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me
was this a lesson god teaching me  was he saying that
im playing the game straight from hell from which few came back
like bad coke pimp or die was my mindframe bad
was nggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack
aint a whole lot of brain to that just trying to maintain a stack
and not collide like two trains thats on the same track         
but get my life together like the oars i bring back
in the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
got my transporter take it cross the border then stop
to set up shop with a quarter of rock  heres the plan
for three straight weeks nggaz slaughtered the block
but you know the game is lluted fcked up me and my dues
one drop can wipe a ngga out faster than the cops
and this unstable way of living just had to stop
half of my nggaz got time we done real things
by ninetyfour became the subject of half of yall nggaz rhymes
public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street
but thats the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets
the life and times of a demonic mind excited with crime
and the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
i figured sht why risk myself i just write it in rhymes
and let you feel me and if you dont like it then fine
the mindstate of a ngga who boosted the crime rate
so high in one city they send national guards to get me
ya dig
the streetsverse one
im done talking
ran up in the spot gun smoking
shot it in the air one woke him
sunsoaking sweating in his bed like dunlo
thinking to himself what done provoked him
his thoughts is racing like a vulcan
i swear i saw a lightbulb when
he finally figured out who was the culprit
i said yeah remember me from friend or foe when
i told you dont ever ever come around here no more
time to pay now you try to rise i wave the gun  lay down
this time youre really going to listen to jay now
i try to talk sensibly hoping that eventually you realize
i had this locked and it just wasnt meant to be
plus i had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
and it wasnt afterthought that maybe youll try to revenge me
but i was like nah chromes had to know he was wrong
and if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
plus you promised
and thats really no fun 
yeah i find you in this motel  with all these guns
and all your goons lined up in adjoining rooms
like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
but my minds like a flower in bloom
 my eyes just scower the room
im alert plus i paid the clerk i got it laid out
you think you the first nigga i played out in a  hotel town 
come on now i peep your lexus at you
left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
money well invested rudely interrupted
jamaican accents  
a gun in your face and thats all you can come up with
im done talking back up and clap them one in the abdomen 
do me a favor dude get  ice cubes i pass them
take that ice up for the nicest mc
and please yo tell big hes unbelievable 
friend or foe biotchhow can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in
theres gotta be them times youll be wrong nah mean
how can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga 
he never even met that he dont even know and shit
i think this rap shit is all beef
yall dont even know every day im livin with stress
got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
cant even enjoy myself at a party unless
im on the dance floor hot ass vest
you think im freakin these chicks right
itry not to brush against they chest

swear to everything when i leave this earth
its gon be on both feet never knees in the dirt
you could try me fucka but when i squeeze it hurts fine
well lose two lives yours and mines
gimme any amount of time dont let ms carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin tears on my sleeve
told the judge didnt budge it was him or me
and i aint trying to be hard but im guilty as charged
put my mercy on this court and my faith in god 
and pray hard none of my nephews wanna be starslucky me
chorus karen anderson
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
i hate all girls with alterior motives
thats why im twenty plus years old no sons no daughters
hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
hear the hate in my voice right i hate that you noticed
niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
hate a nigga like that faggot get your own
hate that i cant roam the street without the clip and chrome
knowing one day ima have to flip cmon

chorus karen anderson jayz
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me 
and now that ive arrived
i see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold
nigga see you in the street pretend to be friendly
but i know any type of success breeds envy
i know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me
leave my friends in a circle pouring out henny
but gs is heaven bound so how im gon receive 
anything yall pour to the ground next time throw it up
and aint nothing changed so even in my afterlife i show it up
dont grieve for me my art remains
like a dart from the speaker to your heart
spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal
plan to leave without a fight i plant a seed i give life

let the fiends know hey we got some dope shit
gon need a middle man so we look to radio
let em test the product give em a promo show
just a breeze not enough to catch a real vibe
then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five
aint tryin to kill em at first just buildin clientele
so when the album drops the first weeks its on sale
but when demand grows its time to expand yo
you dont want no garbage papi its ten grand per blow fo sho

cuts and scratchesuhhuh jeje jejejeah 
yeyeyeah yeyeyeah
how real is this how real is this
uhhuh huh inspect this here check
verse one
im from where the hammers rung news cameras never come
you and your man houndin every verse in your rhyme
where the grams is slung niggas vanish every summer
where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can and run
where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
to achieve this goal quicker sold all my weight wet
faced with immeasurable odds still i get straight bets
so i felt some more something and you nothing check
i from the other side with other guys dont walk to much
and girls in the projects wouldnt fuck us if we talked too much
so they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
i dont know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us
im from where the beef is inevitable summertimes unforgetable
boosters in abundance buy a halfprice sweater new
your world was everything so everything you said youd do
you did it couldnt talk about it if you aint lived it
i from where niggas pull your car and argue all day about
whos the best mcs biggie jayz and nas
where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
at each others throats for the love of foreign cars
where cats catch cases hoping the judge r and rs
but most times find themselves locked up behind bars
im from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
im from marcy son just thought id remind yall
chorus 
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
mentally been many places but im brooklyns own
verse two
im from the place where the chruch is the flakiest
and niggas is praying to god so long that they atheist
where you cant put your vest away and say youll wear it tomorrow
cause the day after well be saying damn i was just with him yesterday
im a block away from hell not enough shots away from straight shells
an ounce away from a triple beam still using a handheld weight scale
your laughing you know the place well
where the liqour stores and the base well
and government fuck government niggas polotic themselves
where we call the cops the ateam
cause they hop out of vans and spray things
and life expectancy so low we making out wills at eightteen
where how you get rid of guys who step out of line your rep solidifies
so tell me when i rap you think i give a fuck who criticize
if the shit is lies god strike me
and i got a question are you forgiving guys who live just like me
well never know
one day i pray to you and said if i ever blow let em know
mistakes aint exactly what takes place in the ghetto
promise fulfilled but still i feel my job aint done
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice
chorus 
verse three
im from where they crossover and clap boards
lost jehovah in place of rap lords listen
im up the block round the corner and down the street
from where the pimps prostitutes and the drug lords meet
we make a million off of beats cause our stories is deep
and fuck tomorrow as long as the night before was sweet
niggas get lost for weeks in the streets twisted off weed
and no matter the weather niggas know how to draw heat
whether your fourfeet or minute size it always starts out with
three dice and shoot the five
niggas thought they douce was live now hit em with trips
and i reached down for their money pa forget about this
this time around its platinum like the shit on my wrist
and this glock on my waist yall cant do shit about this
niggas will show you love thats how they fool thugs
before you know it your lying in a pool of blood
chorus kelly price 
talking throughout my life 
no matter what ive done
youve been merciful and your love endureth 
through all things  for that
i am eternally grateful
verse 
since my date of birth
bought you nothing but hurt
play those video games
stole change from ya purse
sat on the cold court bench
til i was arraigned in ya skirt
saw the pain in ya face
through you maintained a smirk
all you did was motivate me
dont let em hold you back
what i do i turned around
and i sold you crack
i was a bastard for that
still im drowning in shame
just remember one thing now
youre not to blame
you was newly seperated
tryin to escape ya world
and through my thirst
i didnt help you
i just made things worse
i hated me and everybody
that created crack
had me thinkin
the newest kicks and the latest gat
still havent apologized
so please play this back
while i try to come to terms
with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way
cocaine numbs the brain
all i did was think about
how the funds once came
then i ran across this memory 
and it stung the brain
how can you ever destroy the beauty
from which one came
thats a savage youre the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why i rhyme above average and
i aint shit
glad you got yourself together
no thanks to me
strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
you must love me
chorus  
say that you love me
all i know say that you must love me
ohh yeah
verse 
we used to fight every night
but i never would suffer
just smile my big brothers
tryna make me tougher
as we grew fussing and fighting continued
as i plundered through ya stuff
and snuck ya clothes to school
got intense real intense
as we got older
never believed it would lead
to be popped in one of ya shoulda
with my rings knew you had it
cause you took too long
as mickey andy and the girl that bought it looked on
huffin and puffin gun in my hand
told you step outside
hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
made our way down the steps
maybe you thought it was just a threat
or maybe ya life was just that crazy
and you was beggin for death
try to justify this in my young mind
but ya drillin it
and my ego hurt combined
drove me berzerk
saw the devil in your eyes
high off more than weed
confused i just closed
my young eyes and squeezed sorry boys
but all the money in the world couldnt bring me back again
lay down lay down
gonna stretch my mic out in ponce funeral home on marcy
all those new niggaz stop there
but a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
the last of the real hustlers well
maybe not the last
bleeks gonna be a good rapper
new improved jayz

and see my own coffin feelin haunted ready to leave
this world that im lost in my only chance
to see the seeds i lost through abortion

inspect the game yo thats right
 last week i had everything
 i had the money had the cars the bitches
 and the jewelry
	and then my motherfuckin niggaz started snitchin
 beyotch
growin up in the hood just my dog and me
we used to hustle in the hood for all to see
problems i called on him he called on me
we wasnt quite partners i hit him off my p
met him unlocked doors off my keys
yeah we spoke much more than cordially
man he broke bread with me my business spread swiftly
the feds came to get me we both fled quickly
wasnt quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
got caught and thats when our relationship strayed
used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
and when he called collect and i heard his name
i quickly accepted but when i reached the phone
hes talkin reckless i can sense deceit in his tone
i said damn dawg what nine weeks and youre home
he said main man you think shits sweet cause youre home
i just sat spat no more speech in the phone
the crackers up there bleachin your dome youre reachin
i said the world dont stop ive got to keep keep on
from there i sensed the beef was on
i ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
to see if i had bugs and leeches on my phone
cant be too safe cause niggaz is twofaced
and they show the other side when they catch a new case
its on
it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i dont see how this side of you could be provoked
funny what seven days can change
a stand up nigga now you sit down to aim
used to have a firm grip now you droppin names
uhhuh uhhuh 
like i put the toast to your head and made you sell
we both came in this game blind as hell
i did a little better had more clientele
told you put away some cheddar now you cryin for bail
seventeen and im holdin on to around a mill
i could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill
had niggaz thinkin i was from uptown for real
i had so much hustle plus i was down to ill
like a brooklyn nigga straight out of brownsville
down and dirty down to fight the round thirty
freezin on them corners still holdin my crack
lookin up and down the block the fuck is the dough at
came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
you tell them feds i said im never goin back
im from marcy and marcy dont raise no rats
you know the consequences of your acts you cant be serious
the lawyer i retained you said you leakin some things
all this after a week in the bang
im mad at myself cause i didnt spot the weak and lame
i woulda bet the house you wouldnt speak a thang
nigga this was the oath to the top of broke
even pricked our finger anything that got between us
we sposed to cock the ninas what happened to that
instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
fuck it the same thing make you laugh make you cry
thats right the same game that make you mad could make you die
its a dice game and sometimes you crap
who woulda thought youd get popped one time and rap
now you know thats bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up like this is my dad
the labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
youll always be in jail nigga just minus the bars
shit is crazy man
all these niggaz out here snitchin
we was one step away from takin this crack money
and recyclin it through the ghettoes
and buildin back up our own hoods
now all you niggaz start snitchin on each other

i felt his hatred it was harsh fore this fakin shit start
i should take him in back of the building and blaze him
uhoh this nigga jay he aint slow he musta picked up on the vibe
and had i not been so high i woulda been able to hide
tried to cover up myself as i gave him a five
hugged him as if i loved him
to the naked eye
it woulda seemed we was the closest but to those that know us
could see that somethin was about to go down
stay focused
im tryin to concentrate but its like hes reading my mind
as if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
could he see i had plans on bein the man
ever since we first spoke and he put that g in my hand
and i gave it back to show him i was down for the cause
as he approached  and i paused

	this is  yall
	in new york city for the first day in the trial of 
	im gone 
	the state vs shawn carter aka jayz
	uhh uhhuhuh uhh uhhuhuh uhh
	whatever the verdict in this trial may be
	the effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide
aiyyo stand forward fore you take notice
or witness to me killin the track
testify til me spillin the smack
now they got me for traffickin racketeerin audio crack
	they call me dope man dope man
	i try to tell em im where hope floats man
	ghetto spokesman
a broke man approachin the bench with intent
to bury me under the cell fingered me as the toast man
evidence stemmin from ninetysix
they say the world aint recovered from his fix
while they was usin cut i was on some other shit
gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
nowaday the jury got they brow raised
listenin to testimony about my foul ways
exhibit a reasonable doubt
they say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
	you can feel the tension building here
	as an unprecedented number of people have turned out
	for what may be the trial of the century
how come you label your brand of dope
volume  and spread it through the slums
fed it to the young with total disregard
your honor the state seeks the maximum charge
and how could you turn right around
and release a lethal dosage called volume 
and is true you operate the criminal enterprise
known as rocafella in charge of his meteoric rise
and do you deny youre responsible for the demise
of record execs and do you object
your distributions polygram and through your connects
def jam you pushed over five million soundscan
and not to mention your cohorts and henchmen
dame biggs lyor kev and russell simmons
and we aint gon talk about murder inc
that just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
	the state is seeking the maximum penalty
	and with the overwhelming amount of evidence
	the das presented things arent looking good
	despite the grim outlook at this point
	the rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
	in the face of adversity
	jayz is taking the stand
right hand on the bible left hand in the air
before i spoke one word made sure my throat was clear
ahem im a prisoner of circumstance
frail nigga i couldnt much work with my hands
but my mind was strong i grew where you hold your blacks up
trap us expect us not to pick gats up
where you drop your cracks off by the mack trucks
destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
keep us spiralin goin backwards
at age nine saw my first hate crime
blindfolded expected to walk a straight line
mind molded taught to love you and hate mine
climbed over it at a early age jay shined
fuck the system at lady justice i blaze nine
your honor i no longer kill my people i raise mine
the soul of mumia in this modern day time
	while the jury is inside deliberating
	outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation
	well the verdict has just been announced not guilty
	it is complete pandemonium out here 
	people are cheering and hugging  there he is
	jayz is exiting the courtroom right now
	there is a swarm of cameras surrounding him 
	and people are just rushing up to him
	lets try and make our way over there jayz jayz

let me scream your name
i took ya outta jacobs in clusters
busters they wanted to rush us
love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
when you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
you can light up the whole room turning day from night
when the summertime is in and the tops are down
with you around my neck we lock the whole block down 
it took shortsleeves and loungin to understand
the reason they call you ice everybody freeze
aint a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
and that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
the direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
i used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
guess i was jealous that they was so next to you
so i devoted half my time to invest in you
the other half was spent on protecting you
cause you belong to me now sing ya song for me
cmon
chorus x
im often with you so they wonder bout the juice i got
i took you from the projects and an abusive pops
from the bottom to the top

it was then i knew everywhere i went youd follow
soon i spent every dolla you became my habit

you find a dude in town you send him a short message

cause most niggaz dont know a brick from a bike
they keep buyin hard white

fyi i never been robbed in my life
or  you find a chick shit you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you round town like her man
shake hands make friends like its all innocent

or  gorilla pimp come up on that killer shit
take a nigga brick smack him then you sell it back to them

uh huhyeah yeahmotherfuckers 
say that im foolish i only talk about jewels 
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothin i made somethin doin
what i do through and through and
i give you the news  with a twist its just his ghetto pointofview
the renegade you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture bring em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no hes not around  now how that sound to ya jot it down
i bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
i help them see they way through it  not you
cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth you lose your tie and your shirt
since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it with em a minute
cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference  theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict  like you didnt experiment
now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin dogooders  too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
 and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go  hes 
and im the sinister mr kissmyass its just the
 renegade  never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a renegade  never been afraid to talk
about anything  anything  renegade
 never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a  never been afraid to holler
about anything  anything 
i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench

by the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
doorag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me  im awkward i box leftier often
my pops left me an orphan my momma wasnt home
could not stress to me i wasnt grown specially on nights

my demeanor  thirty years my senior
my childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky

no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight

jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatterbrained atheist
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter  a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see its easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me

 cause aint no goin home for me
its a cold cold world but i blew my hand
i drew first cause i knew that man
i knew what he would do if i didnt draw first
and i couldnt stand the thought of my momma steppin foot inside a church
all i try to do is try to get up out the dirt
guess hes tryin to do the same told me get up out his turf
i wanted to talk to him but that shitd never work
we was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
mommas rent his young brothers clothes
my nephews food and with that i sqooze
 and with that i froze
now my life is frozen in time behind these iron poles
and this story is told for young soldiers
who never choose the life we chose
tears in my eyes as i look up im tryin to
hold back my pride but reality is screamin
gotta get a job cause momma also screamin
streets are just like drugs and its like im out here fiendin

okay lets do this 
things just aint the same for gangsters
but im a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
all of these rap singers claimin they bangers
doin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin the game no home trainin or manners
i was doin this shit when you was shittin pampers
i was movin them grams fore you knew what a hand that hand was
duckin the vans radars the scanners
fore you knew what hard white to tame was
i was hittin the turnpike aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cuss aight with them hammers
i was prickin my finger fore you knew what a fam was
i had it laid out fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mill later now you understand us

in the game word to the hyphen in my name
j a y dash hoffa
the past present nigga the future proper
the holy trinity of hiphop is us
we give dre his props but thats where it stops
its the roc
i know you got your eyes on me
i feel you watchin me
but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you bedda off not lookin at all
  
  
  
  
im still on top of the game
still droppin flames still cock and aim
still at the top had the roc for the fame
over setbacks theres been a lot since i came
you seen it all how i got how i gained
the momentum when it dropped how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock they watched me reclaim
the streets they made a special spot for my name
dre haters wanna stop to my reign
but the music lives in me every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the mane
see the world chear for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs itll drive them insane
the eyes that i played
the best to emerge in the game is the watcher
im rated r my brain contains graphics thangs
it turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
its like watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
which means i can see the whole planet in the scene
cash is the topic the object a fatter pocket
some take the crack and chop it but those that havent got it
take away the added profit its catastrophic
i take the gat and cock it and ill sit back and watch it
these new york streets is ugly i keep it gully
the world is mine and cant nobody keep it from me
yo my neighborhood is never sunny
in the place where the number one cause of death is money
you can try copin
ive seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
im still alive and scopin
be another hundred years til my skies close in
and ima die with my eyes open the watcher uhh uhh uhh

pop hurtin assertive flirted with death
damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
grandmas favorite she could not understand
how theres people in the world who wouldnt want me as a neighbor
has to explain to her you think these folks want me in the penthouse
as a reminder that i make top paper
black entrepeneur nobody did us no favors
nobody gave us shit we made us
the rap pack im sinatra dames sam davis

demandin yall respect hand over a check
and while yall at it hand over the jet
we the reason they aint hand over def jam so quick
they new every year i was droppin new product
i was raisin the stock up while buildin the roc up
but thats alright cause they knew they had to see us
when it was time for us to reup make us multimillionires
jejejeah
jeah  in my lifetime
i caught smaller cases but i had capital
hypocritic system let me right back at you
you better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
not even that scratches you specially if you black dude
they dont give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
and they can look good by paintin him as bad news
cause in my past i seen dudes get half of they views
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
so imagine how disturbed i was
when i seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
let me explain exactly how this shit was
this nigga un yo i scratched him he went home without an aspirin
but its cool cause hes back friends and halfinning is over
its in the past and im glad now im back to bein hova

somewhere peaceful for the weekend now its back to speakin of vultures
so the next time that page six approaches us

rose bowl with black karats horse  carriage to spend

of the road because the end im told is nearer than we know
what can i say but live for today hov
yeah the blueprint  homey follow the moves
you put on two tube socks you couldnt walk in my shoes
i was dealt a bad hand fuck what else could i do
but keep somethin up my sleeve thatll help me through
but can you believe everywhere im at models come through
catfightin catwalkin it happens often
its true how society dont want me to move
into the penthouse building with spectacular views
theyre like uhh hes a menace he could never be a tenant
im like ooh whats a young nigga to do
i bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that i dont
give a fuck we just chillin watchin chandelier ceilings high as fuck
old lady dont blow my high
specially if you dont know my life dont make me bring
sharpton in it cause im darkskinneded or
dude with the fro and the rainbow coalition ima
victim of a single parent household born in a mousehole
mousetrap niggaz wanna know
how so how jay get up out that here yeah
i snatched purses i persevered yeah
i had work fiends purchased it was clear
i was out there sellin hope for despair but stop there
i swear i only make good from my mouth to gods ears
had to get out the hood
and i cant justify genocide
but i was born in the city where the skinny niggaz die
born in the city where the skinny niggaz ride
and as a skinny nigga i had beef with high size 
yeah its magic
uhh jayz and lenny kravitz
and its a heavy d production you bastards
come on
ha hey yo stop playin man
this is real serious
ha  yeah yo
 
lets go
post postatono hov hangin with bono
u can live like salvatore ferragamo
and u can cool out poolside at the delano
and u flow like you was out of your mind yo
cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from mcdonalds
would soon be the boss of the big apple ya know
and who knew dude that played ball for the nba
would make a mistake on the who knew estates throw it away
who knew that would be his last shot who drew up that play
they giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
but even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
you could have turned guns into roses like two times today
now heres something you gotta say two times to jay
i got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
got my boom box suntan lotion waiting for action
they say when you play with skills good luck could happen
lets go
 
 its the roc 
thats right
 
things got too hot so i jumped off in this rap shit

too many district attorneys concerned with the actions
of one individual hes criminally attached
i turned in all my rap chips im earning my bachelors
while dating all the models and actresses
im learning all the potholes in every single barrio
trying not to mess up my axis kid
on the road to the riches through trafficking
through rappining and whatevers happening
rocawear im the young black ralph lauren
every time i get out they put me right back in
the michael corleone of the microphone
the michelangelo of flow i paint pictures with poems
i gather no moss like a rolling stone
case the grim reaper visits my home nigga im gone cmon
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
tote more guns then roses foes is 
visibly shook of the invisible bully lets go
flowers need water to grow it gotta rain
and in order to experience joy you need pain
every time a baby is born somebodys slain
you know the saying somebodys lose is anothers gain
the sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
a rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
everything evens up you just wait
even a garbage can gets a steak
you aint even a garbage can you have faith
but when it turns your way before it turns away
gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from jay
you will get return in your investment if attention you pay lets go
 
 its the roc 
 thats right 
 
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses
 
life is all about guns and roses  im not trying to be no big thing no no
you gotta let this one breathe just
just let it breathe for a second
  im not trying to give you no advice

its the gift  the curse
uhh uhh yea
first they love me then they hate me then they love me again
 they love me again
lets take a trip down i gotcha
lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetary
rain grey skies seems at the end of every
young black life is this line damn  him already
such a good kid got us pourin henn already
liquor to the curb for my niggaz up above
when it cracks through the pavement thats my way of sendin love
so give big a hug tell aaliyah i said hi
til the next time i see her on the other side
he was just some thug that caught some slugs
and we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
he walked like ussss talked like ussss
his back against the wall nigga fought like us  damn
poor isis thats his momma name
momma aint strong enough to raise no boy whats his father name
shorty never knew him though he had his blood in him
hot temper momma said he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with him so the streets raised him
isis blamin herself she wish she coulda saved him
damn near impossible only men can raise men
he was his own man not even him can save him
he put his faith in a thirtyeight in his waist
but when you live by the gun you die by the same fate
end up dead before thirtyeight and umm
thats the life of us raised by winter its a cold world
old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
isis life just ended on that rainy day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed
down at the city morgue opened the drawer saw him nude
her addiction grew prescription drugs shift and brew
angel dust dipped in woo
she slipped into her own fantasy world
had herself pregnant by a different dude
but reality bites and this is her life
he wasnt really her husband though he called her wife
it was just this night when moon was full
and the stars were just right and the dress was real tight
had her soundin like lisa lisa  i wonder if i take you home
will you still love me after this night
mike was the hardhead from the around the way
that she wanted all her life shit she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
he was a willie all her life he wasnt really the one to like
it was a dude named shy who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but isis liked this broadway life
she loved the gucci sneakers the red green and whites
hangin out the window when she first seen him fight
she was so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight that
turned into a homicide thatll alter their life
see mike at thirtytwo was still on the scene
had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
sure he saw him as an infant but he dissed on him like
if that was my son he would look much different
see im lightskinnded and that baby theres dark
so its mommas baby poppas maybe
mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets 
had his old reliable thirtyeight gun in his reach
its been fourteen years him and isis aint speak
he runnin around like lifes a peach til one day
he approached this thug that had a mean mug
and it looked so familiar that he called him young cuz
told him get off the strip but the boy aint budge 
instead he pulled out a newer thirtyeight snub
he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused 
there was somethin in this mans face he knew he seen before
its like lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature
and he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
you know what they say about he who hesitates in war
 he who hesitates is lost
he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank
the old man didnt think he just followed his instinct
six shots into his kid out of the gun
niggaz be a father youre killin your son
six shots into his kid out of the gun
niggaz be a father you killin your sons
meet the parents  send correction to this typist

the christmas tree
young hov aint have no pops
thank god man i had the block
yall hear me though
you young fucks got the game all wrong
this is my life man this aint no song
you aint livin your rhymes out you live at your moms house
in that tightass room pullin the cars out
and the mirror pointin at your reflection killing yourself
you american pie stop feeling yourself
nigga you just a worker go deal yourself
stop being a server get a meal yourself
where your heart at all that yickyack aint nobody scared of your gats
we got bigger ones
how many niggas done shot at me shivering
they were so scared they aint hit me once
young hov bout to go to the range
bout to work on perfecting my aimshawn carter was born december th
weighing in at ten pounds eight ounces
he was the last of my four children
the only one who didnt give me any pain when i gave birth to him
and thats how i knew that he was a special child
hi baby whats wrong  you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me is it something that ive done again
 you look like youve lost your best friend
 tell me
they say they never really miss you til you dead or you gone
so on that note im leavin after this song
see you aint gotta feel no way about jay so long
at least let me tell you why im this way hold on
i was conceived by gloria carter and adnus reeves
who made love under the sycamore tree
which makes me a more sicker mc and my momma would claim
at ten pounds when i was born i didnt give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare i made up for birth when i got here
she knows my purpose wasnt hurt cause i aint perfect i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasnt matchin my gear
now im just scratchin the surface cause whats buried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
i went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
hold on
shawn was a very shy child growing up
he was into sports and a funny story is
at four he taught himself how to ride a bike
a twowheel at that isnt that special
but i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up
now all the teachers couldnt reach me and my momma couldnt beat me
hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me so
with that disdain in my membrane
got on my pimp game fuck the world my defense came
then dehaven introduced me to the game
spanish jose introduced me to caine im a hustler now
my gear is in and im in the incrowd
and all the wavy lightskinned girls is lovin me now
my selfesteem went through the roof man i got my swag
got a vocal from this girl when her man got bagged
plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had
supposedly  knowin nobody paid jaz whack ass
im gettin ahead of myself by the way i could rap
that came second to me movin this crack
give me a second i swear i would say about my rap career
til ninetysix came niggaz im here  goodbye
  talking
shawn used to be in the kitchen beating on the table and rapping 
and umm into the wee hours of the morning
and then i brought him a boombox
and his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts 
but that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble
goodbye to the game all the spoils the adrenaline rush
your blood boils you in a spot knowin cops could rush
at you in the drop you so easy to touch
no two days are alike except the st and th pretty much
and trust is a word you seldom hear from us
hustlers we dont sleep we rest one eye up
and a drought could define a man when the well dries up
you learn the worth of water
without work you thirst til you die  yup
and niggaz get tied up for product
and little brothers ring fingers get cut up
to show mothers they really got em
and this is the stress i lived with
til i decided to try this rap shit for a livin
i pray im forgiven  for every bad decision i made
every sister i played  cause im still paranoid to this day
and its nobody fault i made the decisions ive made
this is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
now if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black are you not entertained  are you not entertained

turn the music up turn me down
guru lets go get em again
this time its for the money my nigga
brooklyn stand up
theres never been a nigga this good for this long
this hood or this pop this hot or this strong
with so many different flows theres one for this song
the next one i switch up this one will get bit up
these fucks too lazy to make up shit they crazy
they dont paint pictures they just trace me
you know what  soon they forget where they plucked
they whole style from they try to reverse the outcome
im like  tough
im not a biter im a writer for myself and others
i say a big verse im only biggin up my brother
biggin up my borough im big enough to do it
im that thorough plus i know my own flow is foolish
so them rings and things you sing about bring em out
its hard to yell when the barrells in your mouth

when your cents got that much in common
and you been hustlin since your inception
fuck perception go with what makes sense

 of history in the making during our generation

 twenty years from now youll never be able to say
 that these brothers lied to you jack

im like che guevara with bling on im complex
i never claimed to have wings on
nigga i get mine  by any means on whenever theres a drought
get your umbrellas out because thats when i brainstorm
you can blame shawn but i aint invent the game
i just rolled the dice tryin to get some change
and i do it twice aint no sense in me
lyin as if i am a different man
and i could blame my environment but
there aint no reason why i be buyin expensive chains
hope you dont think users are the only abusers
niggaz gettin high within the game
if you do then how would you explain
im ten years removed still the vibe is in my veins
i got a hustler spirit nigga period
check out my hat yo peep the way i wear it

foolish pride is what held me together through the years
i wasnt felt which is why i aint never played myself

the starrin role in hovitos way

mix the water with the soda
turn the pot up make a souflee
all of yall can get it like groupays in your way
im livin proof that crime do pay
say hooray to the bad guy and all the broads
puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game
puttin caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
all in the name of love
just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
over the house to take back everything that they claimed
or even the worst pain is the distress
learnin youre the mistress only after that love gets slain
and the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
now it gets tough to ever love again
but the allure of the game keeps callin your name
to all the allurists of the world i feel your pain
to all the christies in every cities and tiffany lanes
we all hustlers in love with the same thang
i never felt more alive than ridin shotgun
in clines green  until the cops pulled guns
and i tried to smoke weed to give me the fix i need
what the game did to my pulse with no results
and you can treat your nose and still wont come close
the game is a lightbulb with eleventymillion volts
and im just a moth addicted to the floss
and doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
by any means necessary whatever the cost
even if it means lives is lost
and i cant explain why i just love to get high
drink life smoke the blueberry sky blink twice
im in the blueberry  you blink three times
i may not even be alive
i mean james dean couldnt escape the allure
dyin young leavin a good lookin corpse
of course
once again its the life
i said its the life
once again its the life  oh no
 why i 
get so  uhhuh
hahahahahahaha  wooim just tryin to stay above water yknow
just stay busy stay workin
puff told me like the key to this joint
the key to staying on top of things
is treat everything like its your first project knahmsayin
like its your first day like back when you was an intern
like thats how you try to treat things like just stay hungry
uhh uhh yes yes
yall wanna know why he dont stop
yall wanna know why he dont flop
let me tell you peeople why
came from the bottom of the block i
when i was born it was sworn i was never gon be shit
had to pull the opposite out this bitch
had to get my riide on
eyes on the prize shawn knew i had to
had to had to get these chips
had to make moves like olajuwon
started out sellin dimes and nicks
graduated to a brick
no exaggeration my infatuation with the strip
legendary like a schoolboy
crushin merely nearly every every chick
heavy shit  thats how schoolboy got whipped
and got left on some just me myself and i
on some trugoy shit
had your boys threw place up to a place of no return
had to play with fire and get burned
only way the boy ever gon learn
had to lay way in the cut til i finally got my turn
now im on top in the spot that i earned
its my life  its my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
its my everything
like i never rode in a limo
like i just dropped flows to a demo
like its ninetytwo again and
and i got os in the rental
back in the stu again no prob livin was a whole lot simpler
when you think back you thought that
you would never make it this far then you
take advantage of the luck you handed
or the talent you been given
aint no half steppin aint no no slippin
aint no different from a block thats hidden
gotta get it while the gettings good
gotta strike while the irons hot fore you stop
then you gotta bid it good riddance
goodbye this is my second major breakup
my first was with a pager
with a hooptie a cookpot and the caine
this ones with the stool with the stage with the fortune
maybe not the fortune but certainly the fame
its my life  my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as  when i came
its my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me
its my everything
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst like the first song i sang
woo its like the blues  we gon ride out on this one

but i do know you know what i want from you
give it to me  cmon take away this hennessy
take away me runnin the street
stop people from hatin me take away all of this jealousy
and prejudicy
thought you said it was a better place
i grew up around pimps hustlers hoes and project gangsters
hard to believe in what i cant see
i gotta get this money and feed my family
whatever guillotine guides my life
dear lord dont let me die tonight
but if i shall before i wake what shall i say
its been a good run from hoodlum to island estates
how could one make such foul mistakes
and still be allowed to have a smile on my face
hell whatever the case im glad it wasnt murder
in a town you never hearda from a nickelplated burner
now my lifes straight like a perm
try to take the spot i earned muhfucker better learn
its hov
hey boy hear me out got a few mo things to say

cmere  no  my life on crutches devils say
ill never walk again but the devil is a liar
cause i believe within youre the reason that im still here
even though i dont act like it
even though i hear my calling and fight it
fools do me so wrong its hard to stay righteous
if pimping was a mountain to heaven id hike it
believe me lord i want you
got money and fame and still it just wont do
sometimes i dont like who i am
when i look in the mirror my reflection is uncle sam
and every night i have these weird dreams
that a creatures right beside me  wake up and cant breathe

goin  different directions on a oneway street lord
i got houses money and cars and that

but it still dont matter when im gone and my casket closed go
whatever guillotine guides my life
dear lord dont let me die tonight
but if i shall before i wake id accept my fate
i did what i did my heart was in the right place
i did so i could live to put food on my plate
you musta loved me not to let it end by  that day
well whatever the case im glad it wasnt murder
in a town you never hearda from a nickelplated burner
i guess im not finished with my journey
please forgive me for my sins shit im still trying to learn
meet hov

nigga we right here we can go bank for bank
we can go clip for clip nigga chain for chain

losers lose so when we does what we do we win
and win again like deja vu
then we win again like mj do
threepeat then we retreat to waters thats blue
young scrappy thats what grown man do lets move
in this arena arena
all we wanna see is them hands up hands up
this is for them hustlin boys and girls
its the return of best of both worlds
well once upon a time they left the glove and the star kid
he swore he was the man but he was nothing but garbage
let me rephrase that bubblin with pride
did have skills but he was ugly inside
instead of uplift folks sittin on the non sense
hurtin people feelings like he didnt have a conscience
like i love you when hes hittin that stash
then degraded the shorty like he didnt have class
even let a gay jew man tack his jheri
then got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy
swindlin forgot the god above him
finally fan base trinklin down to nothing
no concern for his estate though was yearnin for a break
bitter and evil didnt learn from his mistake
the moral of the story is dont be a pair of knickers
be good boys and girls and you can be as great as
rick is
my baby mommas robe my rent is overdue
it took half the pay and now my life is filled with rainy days
but i stashed some dough how much youll ever know

shoulda stayed in food and beverage
too much flossing
too much sam rothstein
i aint a bitch but i gotta divorce them
hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
and i aint even want to be famous
niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
and i aint even know how it came to this

the worst drug known to man
its stronger than heroin

and honestly at twentythree
i would probably love my work more than i did she
so we aint we
its me and her
cause what she prefers over me is work
and thats where we differ
so i have to give her
free time even if it hurts
so breathe mami its deserved
youve been put on this earth to be
all you can be like the reserves
and me my time in the army its served
so i have to allow she her time to serve
the times now for her
in time shell mature
and maybe we can be we again like we were

life is but a dream to me
i dont wanna wake up
thirty odd years without having my cake up
so im about my paper
  in a leap year

life is but a beach chair
went from having shabby clothes
crossing over abbey roads
hear my angels singing to me
are you happy hov
i just hope im hearing right
karmas got me feearing life
colleek are you praying for me
i got deamons in my past
so i got daughters on the way
if the prophecys correct
then the child should have to pay
for the since of a father
so i barter my tommorows
against my yesterdays
in hopes that shell be ok
and when im no longere here
the shade of face from the flare
ill give her my share of carols daughter
and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave 
life is just a dream and you really dont wanna wake up wake up 
life is but a dream and you really dont wanna leave
life is but a dream to me
gun shots sing to these
other guys but lullabys
dont mean a ting to me
im not afraid of dyng
im afraid of not trying
everyday hit every wave
like im hawaiian
i dont surf the net
no i never been on myspace
too busy letting my voice vibrate
carving out my space
in this world of fly girls
cutthroats   diamond cut ropes i twirls
benzs round corners
where the sun dont shine
i let the wheels give a glimpse
of hope of ones grind
some said hov how you get so fly
i said from not being afraid to fall out the sky
my physicals shell
so when i say farewell
my soul will find an even
higher plane to dwell
so fly you shall
so have no fear just know that
life is but a beach chair
life is but a dream cant mimic my life
im the thinnest cut slice
intercut the winners cup
with winters rough enough
to interrupt life
thats why im both
the saint  the sinner
nice
this is jay everyday
no compromise
no compass comes with this life
just eyes
so to map it out
you must look inside
sure books can guid you
but your heart defines you
chica
you corason is what brought us home
in great shape like heidi klum
maricon i am on
permanent vaca
life is but a beach chair
this song is like a hallmark card
until you read each here
so till shes here
and she declaired
the aire
i will be prepared
a blueprint for you to print
a map so you can back
a guide for your eyes
and so you wont lose scent
ill make a stink for you to think
i ink these verses full of prose
so you wont get connect out of  cent
my last will and testament i leave my heir
my share of rocafella records and a shiny new beach chair
i hear my angels sing deliver me from my enemies oh god
defend me from all that rise up against me
deliver me from the work of inequity
and save me from the bloody mary
look mind state of a gangster from the s
meets the business mind of motowns berry gordy
turned crack rock into a chain of s
sorry my jewelry is so gaudy
slid into the party with my new pair of mauris
america meet the gangster shawn corey
hey young world wanna hear a story
close your eyes and you can pretend youre me
im cut from the cloth of the kennedys
frank sinatra havin dinner with the genovese
this is the genesis of a nemesis
mother americas not witnessed since
the harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
this is the tale of lost innocence
as the incense burns and the turntables turn
and that al green plays
i see my mothers afro
as mama taps her toes as she rolls her js
and my papa just left the house
in search of the killer of my uncle ray
and shes trying to calm her nerves
as i observe this is just one day
and what tomorrow has in store
we can never be sure so all we can do is pray
because of your strength
while i walk the pond of eden
for god is my deep fix 
as i head to my homeroom
i observe the ruins
dope needles on the ground
i hear a car go vroom
drug dealer in the bm with the top down
as the girls start to giggle
i ask why you laugh
they say youre too little
one day youll understand
when you become a man
bout things you have to get you
fast forward freeze frame on my pistol fistful of dollars
ignorance is so blissful
i aint choose this life this life chose me
around here its the shit that you just do
i just left school
the same bm is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
they had their guns drawn
screaming just move
or is there something else you suggest we can do
he made his way to the trunk
opened it like huh
a treasure chest was removed
cops said hell be back next month
what we called corrupt he calls payin dues
now when the rules is blurred
as they is and were
what am i to do but pray
pray the lord forgive me
pray he guides me by for what im bout to go through pray
 
deliver me in thy righteousness
and cause me to escape
and climb thine air internal
save me thine lord 
geah anywhere theres oppression
the drug profession
flourishes like beverages
refreshing ahhh sweet taste of sin
everything i seen made me everything i am
bad drug dealer or victim i beg
what came first 
moving chickens or the egg
this i why i be so fresh
im trying to beat life cause i cant cheat death
treat shame with shamelessness
and stainless at anuses
you know the game this is
move coke like pepsi
dont matter what the brand name is
i stand behind mine
everything i do im a man behind mine
im not an angel im sure
but every night before i lay
i drop my knees to the floor and i pray
the name shall endure forever
the name shall be continued as long as the sun 
men shall be blessed in him
all nations shall call him blessed
in your name i pray 
lord bless usdreamed of you this morning

uh yeah ay this a special dedication 
i wanna thank you for the fuel no really thank you

i felt so inspired by what my teacher said
said id either be dead or be a reefer head
now sure if thats how adults should speak to kids
especially when the only thing i did was speak in class  ill teach his ass
even betters what my uncle did
i popped my demo tape in started to beat my head
peaked out my eye see if he was beatin his
he might as well say beat it kid hes on the list
its like im searchin for kicks like a sneaker head
he gon keep pushin me until i reach the ledge
and when i reach the ledge ill tell em all to eat a dick
take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread spread spread
the motivation for me 
was them tellin me what i could not be oh well
hey hey
im so ambitious  i might hit two sisters 
hey im on a mission  no matter what the conditions 
forget the personal issues  when you been what i been through 
hey if you believe it  then you could conceive it 
yeah yeah yeah
i had to lace up my boots even harder
father is too far away to father furthermore all the 
kids either smoke reefer or either

so they made light of my type of
dreams seem dumb they said wise up

without a wrinkle in today cause theres no tomorrow
just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
and it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind

as fate would have it jays status appears
to be at an alltime high perfect time to say goodbye

and i need you to remember one thing 
i came i saw i conquered
from record sales to sold out concerts
so muh if you want this encore
i need you to scream til your lungs get sore
tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertoe just caught in the undertoe
and every second i waste is more than i can taaaakkee
ive become so numb
i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
ive become so nuuuuummmbbb
ive become so nuuuummmmbb
so for one last time i need yall to roar
 one last time i need yall to roar jayz lyrics from ohhlacom originally

keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time 
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away and 
i didnt look out below
i watch the time go right out the window
trying to hold on and didnt even know
i wasted it all just to 
i kept everything inside and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when i tried so
scratches
  h to the izzo v to the izza

  oh they havin good old time out there

  yeyeyes

one shot could make a nigga do a full flip
see the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit
hey ma how you know niggaz wanna buy you
but see me i wanna fuck for free like akinyele
take this ride make you feel it inside your belly
if its tight get the ky jelly
all night get you wide up inside the telly
side to side til you say jayz youre too much for me
i am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints but i cant help the fact
that everybody can see these scars
i am what i want you to want what i want you to feel
but its like no matter what i do i cant convince you
to just believe this is real
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that im not
but ill be here cause youre all that ive got
got a condo with nothin but condoms in it
the same place where the rhymes is invented
so all i do is rap and sex imagine how i stroke
see how i was flowin on my last cassette
rapidfire like im blastin a tec never jam though
never get high never run out of ammo
niggaz hatin the shit cause i slayed your bitch
you know your favorite i know it made you sick
and now youre actin raw but you never had war
dont know how to carry your hoes wanna marry your hoe
now shes mad at me causer your majesty just happened to be
a pimp what a tragedy
she wanted us to end cause i fucked with friends
she gave me one more chance and i fucked her again
i seen her tears as she busted in i said shit
theres a draft shut the door bitch and come on in
i am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
cuz you dont understand i do what i can
sometimes i dont make sense
i am what you never wanna say but ive never had a doubt
its like no matter what i do i cant convince you for once just to hear me out
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do
you face away and pretend that im not
ill be here cause youre all that ive got
i cant feel the way i did before
dont turn your back on me

if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
got em mike
hes got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure his caskets closed
rap critics that say hes money cash hoes
hes from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
if you grew up with holes in your zapatoes
youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
so fuck critics you can kiss the whole asshole
if you dont like the lyrics you can press fast forward
got beef with radio if we dont play they show
they dont play our hits  we dont give a shit so
all these mags try and use our ass
so advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
i dont know what you take us as
or understand the intelligence that jayz has
from rags to riches we aint dumb
we got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
 problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now the year is ninetyfour in my trunk is raw
in the rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
i got two choices yall pull over the car or 
bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor 
and i aint tryin to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
so i pull over to the side of the road i heard
  
cause im young and im black and my hats real low
or do i look like a mindreader sir  i dont know
am i under arrest or should i guess some mo
  well you was doin fiftyfive in the fiftyfour
  license and registration and step out of the car 
  are you carryin a weapon on you  i know a lot of you are
i aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
  
well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
  arent you sharp as a tack  you some type of
  lawyer or somethin somebody important or somethin
ha i aint passed the bar but i know a little bit
enough that you wont illegally search my shit
  
i got  problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
this is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
but a pussy havin no god damn sense try an push me
i try to ignore him talk to the lord
pray for him but some fools just love to perform
you know the type loud as a motorbike
but wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing thats gon happen is ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
and there i go trapped in the kitkat again
back through the system with the riffraff again
fiends on the floor scratchin again
paparazzis with they cameras snappin them
da try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mill for bail cause im african
all because this fool was harassin them
tryin to play the boy like hes saccharin
but aint nuttin sweet bout how i hold my gun
i got  problems b and a bitch aint one  hit me
shut up when im talkin to you

dont jerk me boy i rip it silly
ill let you rise of course but if you dont fall off on your own
emcees i cut off at the knees like shorts

tryin to strike a bargain hoping that they might get pardoned

and my cerebral bes the wickedess evil thoughts that this martyr feed you
feedback in the game so deep fiends could catch ya

now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours 
 history so long so long
so long so long
in search of victory she keeps saluting me
if only we can be together momentarily
we can make love and make history
why wont you visit me until she visit me
ill be stuck with her sister her name is defeat
she gives me agony so much agony
she brings me so much pain so much misery
like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
as the crowd screams for the other team
i practiced so hard for this moment victory dont leave
i know what this means im stuck in this routine
whole new different day the same old thing
all i got is dreams nobody else can see
nobody else believes nobody else but me
where are you victory i need you desperately
not just for the moment to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long 
 so long so long
so now im flirting with death 
hustling like a g while victory wasnt watching took chances repeatedly
as a teenage boy before acne before i got proactive i couldnt face she
i just threw on my hoody and headed to the street
i swear i met success we lived together shortly
now success was like lust shes good to the touch
shes good for the moment but shes never enough
everybodys had her shes nothing like v
but success is all i got unfortunately
but im burning down the block hoping in and out of v
but something tells me there is much more to see
before i get killed cause i cant get robbed
so before me success and death ménage
i gotta get lost i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history
now that all the smoke is gone 
and the battle finally won 
victory is finally ours 
history so long so long
so long so long
now victory is mine taste so sweet
shes my trophy wife your coming with me
well have a baby who stutters repeatedly
well name him history hell repeat after me
hes my legacy son of my hard work
future of my past thatll explain who ill be
rank me amongst the greats either one two or three
if i aint number one then ive failed you victory
aint in it for the fame that dies within weeks
aint in it for the money can take it when you leave
i want to be remembered long after you breathe
long after im gone long after i breathe
i leave all i am in the hands of history
thats my last will testimony
this is much more than a song its a baby shower 
ive been waiting for this hour history of ours
now that all the smoke is gone
and the battles finally won 
victory is finally ours
history so long so long
so long so longwhen the sky falls and the earth quakes
we gon put this back together
we wont break
sa pa sé my portauprinces
my haitian gods and all of my princesses
our condolences as you fightin against this
were right by your side as we tryin to make sense of this
heavenly father help us see through these problems
and for those that left accept them into your garden
so heres my theory the countrys already starvin
so we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
god please pardon i speak from the heart
its the only way i see this tragedy befall on them
so lets get involved with them hand to hand with them
arm to arm with them til they get strong again
when the sky falls

so we know we just cant rely on the government
we under the rubble again here we go rumbling when
when we gon catch a break my friend lost his mother and then
and then carline lost her uncles and them
buried with no caskets they just put covers on them
and the tears fall and we fight back
story aint done it cant end like that
nah not like this tomorrows survivors gonna carry on your name
you live on inside us your memorys alive with us
you inspired us to rebuild this country you just guide us
its not the angels that are on their way

so i outblast til its empty clips
and i outlast niggaz survival of the fit
one life i gotta make sure its done right
cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation
ball out until i fall out
stick thick chicks try to tear they wall out
hard to think about your future with nothin to gain
hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain
lifes harsh i know yall runnin from caine
but itll only catch you and track you down
with no deal who you gonna rap to now
start your own record company thats profound

respect this young nigga thats holdin the torch
preachin shit like the crack game dont take shorts

chorus 
verse three sauce money

from umm hoe i dont know to get deez
never excuse me miss bitch please never try to provoke
same disrespectful cat i was when i was broke

or maybe some of the places i shop

for some of the hottest beats still catch me eatin at petes
fuck the foul cat who screamed out and threatened my life
its all good here i come kid dead to the hood
til im in the dirt foul cats like termites
come out of the woodworks if they think you stack paper

and i wish on all the rainbows that i see
i wish on all the people who really dream
and im wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
and im wishing on all the loving weve ever done
we used to play taptap for rap tracks
run catch and kiss in the back park until it got dark
wanted to be like the older males sneak and drink old champale
dangerous games we played on the third rail
fiend for the summer breeze
hopped out the lees dungarees
into the hawaiian shorts relying on sports
to take us away from here but i cut too much
