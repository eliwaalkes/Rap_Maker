as real as it seems the american dream
aint nothing but another calculated schemes
to get us locked up shot up back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names
kept my history of mystery but now i see
the american dream wasnt meant for me
cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom education equality
never gave me nothing but slavery
and now look at how dangerous you made me
calling me a mad man cause im strong and bold
with this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
promise me emancipation indispute nation
all you gave my people was our patience
fathers of our country never cared for me
they kept my answer shackled up in slavery
and uncle sam never did a dam thing for me
except lie about the facts in my history
so now im sitting hear mad cause im unemployed
but the governments glad cause they enjoyed
when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power
panther power
panther power
panther power
coming straight that resides within
go toe to toe with a panther and you just cant win
suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
freedom equality then ill yell out
dont you ever be ashamed of what you are
its ya panther power that makes you a star
panther power
panther power

my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldnt settle for being a statistic
couldnt survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
in my community think of unity
but when i charged them tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of hard disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy youll be clawed to death
cause ill be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
do you remember that is what im asking you
you think you living free dont let me laugh at you

how could this be  how could we both love you
now im trapped in this position and dont know what to do
i could forget about you pretend that we never met
but when im here without you i start to heavily sweat
you give me looks that reinforce the bond thats already there
so many times i find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
play the role like you dont matter he swears that we hate each other
but in reality we cant wait to taste each other
youre my addiction casue i fiend for your desperately
i stand here fantasizin because youre next to me
what can i do with this passion i feel
its too hard to conceal so i know its for real
watched you so many times i know where every curve is
i think you reads my mind and so im feelin nervous
i wana tell you how i feel but that wouldnt help
it would only cause problems so i keep to myself
even though it drives me crazy to see you sittin with him
a tear rolls down my cheek because i see you kiss him
i know the words youre sayin before they can be said
hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
wouldnt hurt the brother for anything in this world
but damn i fell in love with his girl  my burnin heart heart heart

i lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
you know ya love me why must you deny yourself

now im confused cause im no casanova
but you keep callin  youre sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
my burnin heart my burnin heart my burnin hearti know this girl and her name is minnie
livin in the projects didnt own a penny
met her at a school dance so i took a chance
walked her to the parkin lot for a little romance
got to my car put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams i was on a mission
i was catchin wild things like the chicken pox
i was j and knockin boots right down the socks
she was freaky and wild oh man could i call it
but when i dropped her off she had stole my wallet
i couldnt quite believe that why a hoochercoocher
but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher
minnie the moocher was a legend on the block im from
a dream girl to many brothers but true to none
her reputation was enormous  a real go getter
and once a brother met her he wanted to get with her
maybe it was her smile her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
but whatever it was minnie the moocher was an expert
real heartbreaker but never get hurt
she had this boyfriend his name was diamond
helpin minnie out with the little social climbin
met with politicians peace to many others
suddenly and instantly they became her lovers
she took the power that they possessed
and minnie did it all without gettin undressed
minnie dissed diamond sayin that he could not live with her
but he wanted payment for the things he did for her
he grabbed the gun sittin on the nightstand
minnie held the bullets put the pistol in her right hand
she was a legend to everyone who knew her
thats is my memory of minnie the moocher
minnie had a boyfriend a gambler
addicted to poker an alcoholic a basshead crack smoker
he took her to harlem and all around chinatown
he bought some bass a pipe a tape of hardrap sounds
she was an addict tired of the static and poverty
sick of the same ghetto misery
see minnie was a young kid lookin for excitement
smokey was a hoodlum headin for inditement
then one day their relationship stopped
when smokey was killed by the miccops
minnie was hurt lost without a clue
to her there was no chance of gettin somebody new
so she walked home sadly as bad as it seems
she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden
he gave her things that this girl was much needin
a plush house made of gold and steel
a diamond car with a platt in the wheel
now you might think this is a lot of stuff
but to minnie this was not enough
he bought a stable full of thoroughbred race horses
his meal she ate was a dozen courses
she had a fortune in nickels and dimes
and she sat around and counted it a billion times
she had bank yeah minnie was clockin
had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin
she would walk by tryin all to wink her eye
then she dissin with zero reply send corrections to the typist
verse    pac

i get up and go with skins before
when im collecting my dough
i never respect the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap

what kind of style is that
the style of a mack and ready to jack

young black maleyou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what the streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big penn
niggas commin out worse offthan when they went in
over the years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get em ill hit em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against the wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was the wrong street
bang bang count another casualty
but its a cop whose shop is brutality
who do you blame its a shame because the mans slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i let em suffer the payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use the phone 
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes the devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was the ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
trapped

one by one
the problem is 
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
and one by one 
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back
brothers sistas niggas
when i say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplished nigga
niggas what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight 
fight and die if we must like niggas
this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin better livin
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but were the superior
break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emmancipation proclamation please
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocrisy
the constitution yo it dont apply to me
lady liberty stupid bitch lied to me
steady strong nobodys gonna like what i pumpin
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
im fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
theres much more to life than just poverty
this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika amerikkka  
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people 
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy armed with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
armed with the knowledge of the place we been
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i dont get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day im gonna prove them wrong
not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
theyre pulling your sleave dont believe 
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i cant explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother thats living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took out king

we been coochiecoo all through school you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasnt
but like the old saying goes
time goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope gaaaame my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with aks
and though i been around clowning with the underground
im still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for yall if my homies call
its a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang caine on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo caine
you got fame now you run with no shame
i chose rap tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i dont wanna down my homie

but i hear that youre going through some hell pal
but life makin records aint easy

but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
its fate it wasnt my choice to make
to be great im giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
thats why i wrote this song if you ever need me its on
no matter who the foe they must fall
us against them all im down to brawl if my homies callbrendas got a baby

but no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
shes  years old and shes having a baby
in love with a molester whos sexing her crazy
and yet she thinks that hell be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo
she had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
she didnt know what ta throw away and what to keep
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
she didnt realize how much tha the little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in the trash heep balling
momma cant help her but it hurts to hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away momma say you makin me lose pay
the social workers here everyday
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her family they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now whats next there aint nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
its payin tha rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brendas her name shes got a baby
baaaaaaaabyohh shit  jumped on my mans dick

tha lunatic  echoes to fade rebel rebel    rebel
rebel rebel
they just cant stand the reign or the occasional pain
from a man like me who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain so with a little bass and treble
hey mister  its time for me to explain that im the rebel
cold as the devil
straight from the underground the rebel a lower level
they came to see the maniac psychopath
the critics heard of me and the aftermath
i dont give a damn and it shows
and when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me
the lyrical lunatic the maniac emcee
i give a shout out to your homies
and maybe then the criticsll leave your boy alone g
on the streets or on tv
it just dont pay to be a truth tellin mc
they wont be happy till im banned
the most dangerous weapon an educated black man
so point blank in your face pump up the bass
and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cause from the jungle to oaktown they backin me up all the way
you know you gotta love the sound
its from the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground 
now im face to face with the devils
cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
and police brutality
shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
so you reap what you sow
so reap the wrath of the rebel jackin em up once mo
now the fox is in the henhouse creepin up on your daughter
while you sleep i got her sneakin out
tupac aint nuttin nice
ill be nuttin how i wanna and doin what im gonna
now im up to no good
the mastermind of mischief movin more than most could
so sit and slip into the sound
peep the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground 
they say they hate me they wanna hold me down
i guess they scared of the rebel  the rebel of the underground
but i never let it get me
i just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
in fact they tryin to keep me out
try to censor what i say
cause they dont like what im talkin bout
so whats wrong with the media today
got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
but me im comin from the soul
and if it dont go gold my story still gettin told
and that way they cant stop me
and if it sells a couple of copies the punksll try to copy
its sloppy dont even try to
im a slave to the rhythm and im about to fly through
so yo to the people in the ghetto
when ya hear the bass flow go ahead and let go
now everybody wanna gangbang
they talkin street slang but the punks still cant hang
they makin records bout violence 
but when it comes to the real some brothers go silent
it kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin out just to get your record out
but pacalpyse is straight down
so feel the wrath of the rebel  the rebel of the underground

when you come around the block brothas clown a lot
but please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
and when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
and if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
cause sista you dont need him
and i aint tryin to gas ya up i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy 
when brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women do we hate our women
i think its time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we dont well have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man cant make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
aiyyo i remember marvin gaye used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems im headin for tha pen
i try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rainll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know its funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but cant feed the poor
say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
it aint no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we aint meant to survive cause its a setup
and even though youre fed up
huh ya got to keep your head up
and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
cause i think we can make it in fact im sure
and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
you cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because theres too many things for you to deal with
dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
i was given this world i didnt make it
and now my sons getten older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
and its crazy it seems itll never let up but
please you got to keep your head upyo law

and some would say that turned away is all youll get
i just said bet and never let em see me sweat

while nonbelievers were prayin for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart im knowin that they wish me hell

puffin weed as i position myself to clock gs
my enemies scatter in suicidal situations
never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
evadin the playa hatin tricks while hittin switches
bitches is badmouth cause brawlin motherfuckers is bold
but yall some hoes the game should be sewed
im sick of psychotic society somebody save me
addicted to drama so even mama couldnt raise me
even the preacher and all my teachers couldnt reach me
i run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
im duckin the cop i hit the weed as im clutchin my glock
niggaz is hot when i hit the block what if i die tonight
if i die tonight 
tonights the night i get in some shit > dr dre
polishin pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
when i get to poppin niggaz is droppin then they done
callin the coroner come collect the fuckin corpse
he got it by killer preoccuppied with bein boss
revenge is the method whenever steppin keep a weapon close
adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails
hit the block and fill your pockets makin crack sales
picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me my pistol posses usin deadly force
in my brain all i can think about is fame
the police know my name a different game aint a thing changed
im seein cemetary photos of my peers
conversatin like they still here if i die tonight
chorus
pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
plottin on murderin motherfuckers fore they get you
pray to the heavens threefiftysevens to the sky
and i hope im forgiven for thug livin when i die
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto for thug niggaz
a stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
pissin while practicin how to pimp and be a playa
overdose of a dick while drinkin liquor when i lay her
pistol whippin these simps for bein petrified and lame

verse one pac
can you picture my prophecy
stress in the city the cops is hot for me

witnessin killings leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
carries to children cause theyre illin
addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
without feelin but will they last or be blasted
hard headed bastard
maybe hell listen in his casket  the aftermath
more bodies being buried  im losing my homies in a hurry
theyre relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my visions blurried
the question is will i live  no one in the world loves me
im headed for danger dont trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever im feelin this anger
dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	its just me against the world
	ooooh yeah ooohooo
	its just me against the world
	me against the world
	cause its just me against the world baby

verse two dramacydal

is there another route  for a crooked outlaw
veteran a villian a young thug who one day shall fall
everday theres mo death and plus im doughless
im seein mo reasons for me to proceed with thievin
scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
cause aint no bucks to stack up my nuts is backed up

verse three pac
with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finaly get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
dont settle for less  even the genius askses questions
be grateful for blessings
dont ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
if im insane its the fame made a brother change
it wasnt nuttin like the game
its just me against the world
	me against the world
	nuttin to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	got me stuck in the game
	its just me against the world
	oahahhhh
	id be ashamed to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
outro pac
heh hahahahahahah
thats right
i know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
remember one thing
through every dark night theres a bright day after that
so no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
keep your head up and handle it
	me against the world i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through the valley of death
i shed so many tears 
please god walk with me 
back in elementary i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dyin breed
inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can you feel me im not livin in the past you wanna last
be tha first to blast remember kato
no longer with us hes deceased
call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
now rest in peace
is there heaven for a g  remember me
so many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
ahh i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now that im strugglin in this business by any means
label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause im cursed im havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse god can you feel me
take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
show me some happiness again im goin blind
i spend my time in this cell aint livin well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail
my life is in denial and when i die 
baptized in eternal fire ill shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now im lost and im weary so many tears
im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a calculated step to bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothin left
there was no mercy on the streets i couldnt rest
im barely standin bout to go to pieces screamin peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just a misery
paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
will i survive til the monin to see the sun
please lord forgive me for my sins cause here i come
lord i suffered through the years  and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord knows i tried been a witness to homicide
seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
brokenhearted as i glance at the chalk line gettin high
this aint the life for me i wanna change
but aint no future right for me im stuck in the game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
disillusioned lately ive been really wantin babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
im hearin noises think she fuckin all my boys cant take no more
im fallin to the floor beggin for the lord to let me in
to heavens door  shed so many tears
lord ive lost so many years and shed so many tears
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears

verse one pac
      
when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought id see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddys the same drama
when things went wrong wed blame mama
i reminice on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and whod think in elementary
heeey i see the penitentiary one day
and runnin from the police thats right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama

theres no way i can pay you back
but the plan is to show you that i understand

verse two pac
now aint nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
he passed away and i didnt cry cause my anger
wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
they say im wrong and im heartless but all along
i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rents due
i hope ya got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin home after work late
youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
ya just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough youre alone
youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus
verse three pac
pour out some liquor and i reminsce cause through the drama
i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that im hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act craaazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
everything will be alright if ya hold on
its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated

late night phone conversations  would that be ok
i dont wanna take up all your time be the next in line

i can see youre cautious and im careful not to scare you
but anticipation of love makin 
got you shakin when im standin near you

now the pictures getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
i tell you to leave him and you tell me keep my faith in god
i dont understand i just wanna bring ya home
i wonder should i leave you alone and find a woman of my own
all the homies tell me that you dont deserve it

a bitch can be like fifteen fuckin with a nigga 
gettin him for ends
hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
when these niggaz get to trickin hahaha its over then
thats aight though
keep a nigga heavy in the game bout so long
watch them hoes
all you niggaz out there
beware these lyin ass scandalous bitchesverse one daz
you find an mc like me whos strong
leavin motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda im on those 
who can withstand the mo power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate its been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard im faced with it im a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
im soon to count the bodies
verse two tupac
so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
we must be based on nothin better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin
no more procrastination give up to fate and get that asss shakin
im bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
dont take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet
its similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out forgive me janet
whos in control im acvtivatin yo souls
you know the way the games get controlled
yo two years ago a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme i wrote
takin off my coat clearing my throat
chorus method man
i got my mind made up come on 
get in get in too

verse three kurupt
well i comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin sac wont collapse
cause nowadays shits evading the xrays
sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mcs
shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder im just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
im an mc with lyrics thats tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed thats before its ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
theres no escape nah i aint blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mcs im the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camps under seige and im jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
im out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
verse four method man
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up  wit german 
the mr methtical from staten isle
will be back after this message dont touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket  blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clans three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or thats that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
verse five redman
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
lets face it theres no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit im laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when im splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch dont get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs cant fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you gets lot
with this underground cannabis
im dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lps
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
im the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee  coly

heaven aint hard to find
heaven aint hard to findin todays music news the ever controversial tupac shakur has
just released another album under the alias makaveli
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only mr shakur but of death row records as well
nas the alleged ring leader of it is furious at tupac
excuse me makavelis verbal assault
on mobb sleep notorius pig and several other new york rappers
jayz from hawaiian sophie fame big little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release

	as we forgive our debtors
	lead us not into temptation
	but deliver us unevil
	for god is the kingdom and the power
	and the glory forever and ever and everin the life we live as thugs
everbody fuckin wit us so cant you see

where are we now guns found daily the feds surely hope
that they could finally nail me for sellin dope
they backwards make tracks burst whenever i rap

look at me laugh at my competition flashin my jewelry
youd stay silent if you niggaz knew me truly effective

cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom education equality
never gave me nothing but slavery
and now look at how dangerous you made me
calling me a mad man cause im strong and bold
with this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
promise me emancipation indispute nation
all you gave my people was our patience
fathers of our country never cared for me
they kept my answer shackled up in slavery
and uncle sam never did a dam thing for me
except lie about the facts in my history
so now im sitting hear mad cause im unemployed
but the governments glad cause they enjoyed
when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power
panther power
panther power
panther power
coming straight that resides within
go toe to toe with a panther and you just cant win
suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
freedom equality then ill yell out
dont you ever be ashamed of what you are
its ya panther power that makes you a star
panther power
panther power
panther power
panther power
my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldnt settle for being a statistic
couldnt survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
in my community think of unity
but when i charged them tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of hard disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy youll be clawed to death
cause ill be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
do you remember that is what im asking you
you think you living free dont let me laugh at you
open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
said you wasnt civilized and stole your name
cause some time has passed seem you all forget
there aint no liberty to you and me we all aint free yet
panter power

pac 
they finally did it 
they stole the mic i grip
now that its gone 
im feelin tired and sick
 i dont know i wasnt sleepin that long
when i woke up 
my microphone was gone
first i paniced 
i put the cops on the case
but they was stumped 
without a clue or a trace
so as sure a smoking cigarettes is bad for your health
if i want my microphone back ill find it myself
so i picked up the phone 
i called dizzy 
my mics gone 
lets get busy
before i told dizzy what i wanted to do
he was over at my house with the tms crew
he said word is out on every mouth on the street
now that its gone its not long til your beat
and then it hit me 
i got a battle at 
with out my microphone
im guaranteed to get whipped
ya might think its unbelievable
but word to the strength
when it comes to rockin rhymes
im a musical nimth
they gave me other mics
but yo it wasnt no use
i tried to rock it 
but i couldnt get loose
i said forget it
ya microphone or not
and i got to do this
give it all that i got 
itd be the first time i lost
but if i beat em itd finally prove that im the boss
i grabbed my leather jacket
walked through the streets
was hopin and payin
strictly dope wont get beat
i begin to get hyped
i was ready to fight
yo i was confident that i win
to hell with the mic
i hop on to the stage
dizzy started the beat
the sucka shivered
because he tasted defeat
then i signaled to dizzy
bust a rhyme wit my head
perpetrator fell back 
and then he was dead
i was happy as hell
cause i was lucky that night
put my hand in my pocket
and there was my mic
hahalet knowledge drop
why should i be forced to play dumb
i know where i came from so im going to claim some
but rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
stop think of the past the brothers that die for
sucker to try for never to cry more
tricks to hold his back but well see at the end
hes a fake not a friend
so hes thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
yo hes a trick so he sold his soul for gold
now i know the reason we must excel
cause if we dont well end up in the cell
move on be strong with unity
cause thats the only way to build communities
lies are told but yo lives must move on
and never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
yo im running so i refuse to stop
get sweated by them sell out cops
and i wink cause i pin the opposition
im on a mission to preach and teach to reach
so listen up to the flavor i gave you now dropping it
we folks know ballers know no stopping it
dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
i got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm 
for the simple fact that im black and educated
proud of who am i and you hated
so all i have tried for this many have die for this
you see it and you hear it and you loving it
now you buying this always keep your head look to the mountain top
aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
suckers suffocate when i hype this because you can write this
you constantly bite this
thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
caught with the dope dose
now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
cause you building a boom force
like what you hearing so your checking with the source
tupac brother with the rhymes to rock on
dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
im not conceited but defeated i wont be
as long as theres dope beats ill never be lonely stop
and let me breathe a minute
aiyyo dizzy whats up put the base back in it
let knowledge drop 
by any means neccessary its kind of scary
knowledge of the hands of adversaries
makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
i was waiting for a present god gave me a goal
i refuse to be busting like a sucker for im fighting like a titan
and run you down like a truck
ill take a chance i vote for rock can see
not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me

we get out the car and can barely stand
cause everywhere i look are screamin fans
girls on my tip but i really dont sweat em
theyll tear my new clothes if your bodyguradll let em
hit backstage with two minutes to spare
just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
we hear the introduction the audience is loud
i stepped out on the stage and then i moved the crowd
winners all over we tried to leave the scene
but theres a whole crowd of people at the limousine
pen and paper in my face i couldnt be mean
so i was signin autographs at the age of seventeen
people wonder why i choose to live the hype
its not hard to understand its just a day in the life
kick it  its a day in the life
kick it kick it kick it
coolin with my posse at the neighborhood disco
talkin to a cutie as im sippin on my cisco
askin me to dance but i keep on sayin no
hate to dance fast i only like to do it slow
dizzys on the dance floor funky funky motion
girl keeps on sweatin me with sexual kind of totions
roc is signin autographs makin girlies dizzy
crowd sweatin strictly dope cause were gettin busy
suckers wanna battle us we move in silence
strictly dope is positive were tryin to stop the violence
started feel tipsy im lookin for the door
the cisco had me dizzy i stumbled to the floor
and more i try to sit up the less i seem to get up
my stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit up
the room begins to spin i pass out for the night
just another way of livin a day in the life kick it
knew i was a genius soon as you seen this
avoid hoes value dont have to redeem this
teenage terror no room for error
a girl start dissin and i scare her
risin like inflation on your favorite station
rap is my forte and my recreation
girls wanna kiss me suckers wanna diss me
my mother didnt want me to be but ima emcee
the ladies desire emcees admire
thats why many hate me and call me liar
hoods of the hypetip girls on the illtrip
im through rockin this whack so thats it
i am the high type my style is so right
its not hard to understand its just a day in the lifei lay awake tonight because i wanna be with you
if you were beside me id playfully kiss you
each time i see ya the feelin gets stronger
you sit a bit closer we stare a lot longer
huh  reach for my drink and for a second we touch
words are muttered i stutter cause i want you that much
the situation is a nowin cause hes my best friend
but now im guilty of fallin for his girlfriend
i know its wrong but my heart is filled with purity
i offer passion but he offers security
its like a trap that im sinkin into
i wake up sweaty when im sleepin cause im thinkin of you
then we make eye contact and i cant hold back
i try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
what have i gotten into i feel posessed by you
i have these thoughts at night of undressin you
its kinda obvious blind men might see it
but he doesnt so he keeps on trustin me
leaves me alone wit you while hes on vacation
well how could he leave me with this temptation
now im confused cause im no casanova
but you keep callin  youre sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
girl you are my one and only
you are my angel and now ya wanna leave me lonely
what did i do  baby did i treat you bad
my heart is broken and now ya make me sad
i remember when this love affair first started
we was so in love and now we are departed
girl ill buy ya anything ya heart desires
i have to let ya know baby youre my fire
warm and wet each kiss is prolonged
its your sweet caress that makes rock t strong
just bein with you and seein the two of us
walkin along the beach cause girl you are my peach
so sweet and tender my love i surrender
no need to pretend that youll want it to end
ill never let you go youre forever my girl
ya know why  cause girl you are my world
my burnin heart
totally tounge tied every three seconds i keep watchin you
hes my best friend but i cant help clockin you
how could this be  how could we both love you
now im trapped in this position and dont know what to do
i could forget about you pretend that we never met
but when im here without you i start to heavily sweat
you give me looks that reinforce the bond thats already there
so many times i find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
play the role like you dont matter he swears that we hate each other
but in reality we cant wait to taste each other
youre my addiction casue i fiend for your desperately
i stand here fantasizin because youre next to me
what can i do with this passion i feel
its too hard to conceal so i know its for real
watched you so many times i know where every curve is
i think you reads my mind and so im feelin nervous
i wana tell you how i feel but that wouldnt help
it would only cause problems so i keep to myself
even though it drives me crazy to see you sittin with him
a tear rolls down my cheek because i see you kiss him
i know the words youre sayin before they can be said
hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
wouldnt hurt the brother for anything in this world
but damn i fell in love with his girl  my burnin heart heart heart
my heart is burnin ya know its yearin for ya sweet caress
i lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
you know ya love me why must you deny yourself
what i can offer you yet you want somebody else
its not that  well then girl what could it be
i hope im good for you cause baby youre so good for me
many nights i cried and tried to make this work
then act the fool and cool and cruel like the church
well im sorry baby i have to let you know
you are my life my strength i refuse to let you go
you are so beautiful baby you light up my life
i close my eyes and dream of that youll become my wife
day in and day out its you i pray about
dont lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
i love you cause honey youre like a work of art
you got me on fire  my burnin heart
i lay awake tonight because i wanna be with you
if you were beside me id playfully kiss you
each time i see ya the feelin gets stronger
you sit a bit closer we stare a lot longer
huh  reach for my drink and for a second we touch
words are muttered i stutter cause i want you that much
the situation is a nowin cause hes my best friend
but now im guilty of fallin for his girlfriend

well how could he leave me with this temptation
now im confused cause im no casanova
but you keep callin  youre sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
my burnin heart my burnin heart my burnin hearti know this girl and her name is minnie
livin in the projects didnt own a penny
met her at a school dance so i took a chance
walked her to the parkin lot for a little romance
got to my car put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams i was on a mission
i was catchin wild things like the chicken pox
i was j and knockin boots right down the socks
she was freaky and wild oh man could i call it
but when i dropped her off she had stole my wallet
i couldnt quite believe that why a hoochercoocher
but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher
minnie the moocher was a legend on the block im from
a dream girl to many brothers but true to none
her reputation was enormous  a real go getter
and once a brother met her he wanted to get with her
maybe it was her smile her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
but whatever it was minnie the moocher was an expert
real heartbreaker but never get hurt
she had this boyfriend his name was diamond
helpin minnie out with the little social climbin
met with politicians peace to many others
suddenly and instantly they became her lovers
she took the power that they possessed
and minnie did it all without gettin undressed
minnie dissed diamond sayin that he could not live with her
but he wanted payment for the things he did for her
he grabbed the gun sittin on the nightstand
minnie held the bullets put the pistol in her right hand
she was a legend to everyone who knew her
thats is my memory of minnie the moocher
minnie had a boyfriend a gambler
addicted to poker an alcoholic a basshead crack smoker
he took her to harlem and all around chinatown
he bought some bass a pipe a tape of hardrap sounds
she was an addict tired of the static and poverty
sick of the same ghetto misery
see minnie was a young kid lookin for excitement
smokey was a hoodlum headin for inditement
then one day their relationship stopped
when smokey was killed by the miccops
minnie was hurt lost without a clue
to her there was no chance of gettin somebody new
so she walked home sadly as bad as it seems
she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden
he gave her things that this girl was much needin
a plush house made of gold and steel
a diamond car with a platt in the wheel
now you might think this is a lot of stuff
but to minnie this was not enough
he bought a stable full of thoroughbred race horses
his meal she ate was a dozen courses
she had a fortune in nickels and dimes
and she sat around and counted it a billion times
she had bank yeah minnie was clockin
had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin
she would walk by tryin all to wink her eye
then she dissin with zero reply send corrections to the typist
verse    pac 
they finally did it 
they stole the mic i grip
now that its gone 
im feelin tired and sick
 i dont know i wasnt sleepin that long
when i woke up 
my microphone was gone
first i paniced 
i put the cops on the case
but they was stumped 
without a clue or a trace
so as sure a smoking cigarettes is bad for your health
if i want my microphone back ill do it my self
so i picked up the phone 
i called dizzy 
my mics gone 
lets get busy
before i told dizzy what i wanted to do
he was over at my house with the tms crew
he said word is out on every mouth on the street
now that its gone its not long til your beat
and then it hit me 
i got a battle at 
with out my microphone
im guaranteed to get whipped
ya might think its unbelievable
but word to the strength
when it comes to rockin rhymes
im a musical nimth
they gave me other mics
but yo it wasnt no use
i tried to rock it 
but i couldnt get loose
i said forget it
ya microphone or not
and i got to do this
give it all that i got 
itd be the first time i lost
but if i beat em itd finally prove that im the boss
i grabbed my leather jacket
walked through the streets
was hopin and payin
strictly dope wont get beat
i begin to get hyped
i was ready to fight
yo i was confident that i win
to hell with the mic
i hop on to the stage
dizzy started the beat
the sucka shivered
because he tasted defeat
then i signaled to dizzy
bust a rhyme wit my head
perpetrator fell back 
and then he was dead
i was happy as hell
cause i was lucky that night
put my hand in my pocket
and there was my mic
haha

cause i aint a crook despite how i look
i dont sell llello
theyre judging a brother like covers and books
follow me into a flow
im sure you know which way to go
im hittin em out of the dopes
so slip on the slope lets skip on the flow
im fuckin the sluts and hoes
the bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
the gimminy jimminy grows
then whaddya know its off with some clothes
i love when the crowd says ho
that lets me know they know i can flow
love when they come to my shows
i get up and go with skins before
when im collecting my dough
i never respect the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap
the bigger the check now watch how they sweat
what kind of style is that
the style of a mack and ready to jack
i rendered up piles of black
the wacker the pack the fatter the smack
i hate it when real nigga bust

        we gonna say who the big mouth when i come back
young black maleyou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what the streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big penn
niggas commin out worse offthan when they went in
over the years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get em ill hit em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against the wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was the wrong street
bang bang count another casualty
but its a cop whose shop is brutality
who do you blame its a shame because the mans slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i let em suffer the payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use the phone 
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes the devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was the ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
trapped 
all you wanted to be a soulja a soulja
all you wanted to be a soulja like me
all you wanted to be a soulja a soulja
all you wanted to be a soulja like me
 audible after pac says the word welfare

he had tha nerve to say that i had a curfew
do you know what time it is
 get out the fucking car or ill hurt you
get out the car or ili hurt you
so here i go i better make my mind up
pick my nine up or hit the lineup
i chose b stepped into the streets
the first cop grabbed me the other ripped my seat
they grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
  they tried to frame me
they tried to say i had some dope in the back seat
but im a rap fiend not a crack fiend
my homie panicked  he tried to run 
 i heard a bullet fire from the cops gun
my homie dropped so i hit the cop
i kept swingin yo i couldnt stop
before i knew it i was beatin the cop senseless
the other cop dropped his gun he was defenseless
now im against this cop who was racist
given him a taste of tradin places
and all this cause the peckerwood was tryin this
frame up but i came up
now they claimin that im violent
chorus
as i was beatin on a cop i heard a gun click 
then the gun shot but i wasnt hit
i turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
he shot the cop  now hes a dead man
i said come on its time for us to get away
they called for backup and theyll be on their way
jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
the car wouldnt start  we in deep shit
so we jumped out  
we drove a little ways thinkin that we got far
but i looked up and all i saw was blue lights
if i die tonight im dying in a gunfight
i grabed the ak my homie took the  gauge
load em up quick its time for us to spray
well shoot em up with they own fuckin weapons
and when we through sprayin  then we steppin
this is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops

chorus 
chorus

chorus killing us one by one 
in one way or another
american will find a way to eliminate the problem
one by one
the problem is 
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
and one by one 
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back
brothers sistas niggas
when i say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplished nigga
niggas what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight 
fight and die if we must like niggas
this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin better livin
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but were the superior
break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emmancipation proclamation please
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocrisy
the constitution yo it dont apply to me
lady liberty stupid bitch lied to me
steady strong nobodys gonna like what i pumpin
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
im fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
theres much more to life than just poverty
this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika amerikkka  
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people 
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy armed with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
armed with the knowledge of the place we been
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i dont get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day im gonna prove them wrong
not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
theyre pulling your sleave dont believe 
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i cant explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother thats living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took out king

we been coochiecoo all through school you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasnt
but like the old saying goes
time goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope gaaaame my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with aks
and though i been around clowning with the underground
im still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for yall if my homies call
its a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang caine on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo caine
you got fame now you run with no shame
i chose rap tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i dont wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go youre not lowly
and i hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me call
if you need my assistance therell be no resistance

word if my homies call
well its ninetyone and im livin kinda swell now
but i hear that youre going through some hell pal
but life makin records aint easy
it aint what i expected its hectic its sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
its fate it wasnt my choice to make
to be great im giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
thats why i wrote this song if you ever need me its on
no matter who the foe they must fall
us against them all im down to brawl if my homies callbrendas got a baby

but no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
shes  years old and shes having a baby
in love with a molester whos sexing her crazy
and yet she thinks that hell be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo
she had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
she didnt know what ta throw away and what to keep
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
she didnt realize how much tha the little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in the trash heep balling
momma cant help her but it hurts to hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away momma say you makin me lose pay
the social workers here everyday
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her family they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now whats next there aint nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
its payin tha rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brendas her name shes got a baby
baaaaaaaabyohh shit  jumped on my mans dick

tha lunatic  echoes to fade rebel rebel    rebel
rebel rebel
they just cant stand the reign or the occasional pain
from a man like me who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain so with a little bass and treble
hey mister  its time for me to explain that im the rebel
cold as the devil
straight from the underground the rebel a lower level
they came to see the maniac psychopath
the critics heard of me and the aftermath
i dont give a damn and it shows
and when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me
the lyrical lunatic the maniac emcee
i give a shout out to your homies
and maybe then the criticsll leave your boy alone g
on the streets or on tv
it just dont pay to be a truth tellin mc
they wont be happy till im banned
the most dangerous weapon an educated black man
so point blank in your face pump up the bass
and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cause from the jungle to oaktown they backin me up all the way
you know you gotta love the sound
its from the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground 
now im face to face with the devils
cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto

i guess they scared of the rebel  the rebel of the underground
but i never let it get me
i just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
in fact they tryin to keep me out
try to censor what i say
cause they dont like what im talkin bout
so whats wrong with the media today
got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid

and if it dont go gold my story still gettin told
and that way they cant stop me
and if it sells a couple of copies the punksll try to copy
its sloppy dont even try to
im a slave to the rhythm and im about to fly through
so yo to the people in the ghetto
when ya hear the bass flow go ahead and let go
now everybody wanna gangbang

they makin records bout violence 
but when it comes to the real some brothers go silent

when you come around the block brothas clown a lot
but please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
and when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
and if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
cause sista you dont need him
and i aint tryin to gas ya up i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy 
when brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women do we hate our women
i think its time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we dont well have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man cant make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
aiyyo i remember marvin gaye used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems im headin for tha pen
i try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rainll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know its funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but cant feed the poor
say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
it aint no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we aint meant to survive cause its a setup
and even though youre fed up
huh ya got to keep your head up
and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
cause i think we can make it in fact im sure
and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
you cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because theres too many things for you to deal with
dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
i was given this world i didnt make it
and now my sons getten older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
and its crazy it seems itll never let up but
please you got to keep your head upyo law
is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one

and i still dont give a fuck yaknahmsayin
puffin on this indo in the studio with my partners out here
pacific heights in the house know what i mean
   
i was framed so dont make the same mistake nigga

cause the police love to break a nigga
send em upstate cause they straightup hate the niggaz
so what i do is get a crew of zoo niggaz

and onetime had enough of me
im still raw so the law cant fuck with me
they wanna send me to the pen punk picture that
i stay strapped motherfuckers better get your gat

life as a celebrity aint everything they make it
and ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
if they cant screw me they find a way to sue me

since i wear a lot of gold they plot

after the darkest night always comes a brighter day
and some would say that turned away is all youll get
i just said bet and never let em see me sweat
cause in the end i knew that i would have it all
while nonbelievers were prayin for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart im knowin that they wish me hell
yo get a real job rappin doesnt pay the rent
i hate the studio cause thats where all my money went
never surrender its all about the faith youve got
dont ever stop just push it til you hit the top
and if you drop at least you know you gave your all
be true to you and that way you can never fall
but beware these backstabbers aint no joke
just like a rope they hang on you until youre broke
and when youre broke they move onto the next dope

amongst tha babies who raised up from tha slavery
i sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
moved out west and i invest in all tha best
those who test will find a bullet in they chest
put ta rest
by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
how many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
im sick of being tired
sick of tha sirens body bags and tha gun firing

moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
grow up rough and its hard to understand stuff
moms was tough cause his poppa wasnt man enough
couldnt stand up to his own responsibilities
instead of takin care of me hed rather live lavishly
thats why ill never be a father
unless you got the time its a crime dont even bother

im so sorry
for all this time

addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
without feelin but will they last or be blasted
hard headed bastard
maybe hell listen in his casket  the aftermath
more bodies being buried  im losing my homies in a hurry
theyre relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my visions blurried
the question is will i live  no one in the world loves me
im headed for danger dont trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever im feelin this anger
dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	its just me against the world
	ooooh yeah ooohooo

verse two dramacydal

verse three pac
with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finaly get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
dont settle for less  even the genius askses questions
be grateful for blessings
dont ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
if im insane its the fame made a brother change
it wasnt nuttin like the game
its just me against the world
	me against the world
	nuttin to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	got me stuck in the game
	its just me against the world
	oahahhhh
	id be ashamed to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
outro pac
heh hahahahahahah
thats right
i know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
remember one thing
through every dark night theres a bright day after that
so no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
keep your head up and handle it
	me against the world i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through the valley of death
i shed so many tears 
please god walk with me 
back in elementary i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dyin breed
inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can you feel me im not livin in the past you wanna last
be tha first to blast remember kato
no longer with us hes deceased
call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
now rest in peace
is there heaven for a g  remember me
so many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
ahh i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now that im strugglin in this business by any means
label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause im cursed im havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse god can you feel me
take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
show me some happiness again im goin blind
i spend my time in this cell aint livin well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail
my life is in denial and when i die 
baptized in eternal fire ill shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now im lost and im weary so many tears
im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a calculated step to bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothin left
there was no mercy on the streets i couldnt rest
im barely standin bout to go to pieces screamin peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just a misery
paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
will i survive til the monin to see the sun
please lord forgive me for my sins cause here i come
lord i suffered through the years  and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord knows i tried been a witness to homicide
seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
brokenhearted as i glance at the chalk line gettin high
this aint the life for me i wanna change
but aint no future right for me im stuck in the game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
disillusioned lately ive been really wantin babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
im hearin noises think she fuckin all my boys cant take no more
im fallin to the floor beggin for the lord to let me in
to heavens door  shed so many tears
lord ive lost so many years and shed so many tears
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears

verse one pac
      
when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought id see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddys the same drama
when things went wrong wed blame mama
i reminice on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and whod think in elementary
heeey i see the penitentiary one day
and runnin from the police thats right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama

verse two pac
now aint nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
he passed away and i didnt cry cause my anger
wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
they say im wrong and im heartless but all along
i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rents due
i hope ya got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin home after work late
youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
ya just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough youre alone
youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus
verse three pac
pour out some liquor and i reminsce cause through the drama
i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that im hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act craaazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
everything will be alright if ya hold on
its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated

i can see youre cautious and im careful not to scare you
but anticipation of love makin 
got you shakin when im standin near you
news of precision will prepare ya
in case you get scared just ask the man in the mirror
now the pictures getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
i tell you to leave him and you tell me keep my faith in god
i dont understand i just wanna bring ya home
i wonder should i leave you alone and find a woman of my own

who can withstand the mo power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate its been withstandin faded

when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard im faced with it im a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
im soon to count the bodies
verse two tupac

dont take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet

of the bomb prophalaks for protection

shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder im just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
im an mc with lyrics thats tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed thats before its ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
theres no escape nah i aint blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mcs im the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camps under seige and im jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
im out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
verse four method man
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up  wit german 
the mr methtical from staten isle

melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clans three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or thats that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
verse five redman
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
lets face it theres no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit im laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when im splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch dont get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs cant fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you gets lot
with this underground cannabis
im dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lps
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
im the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope

heaven aint hard to find
heaven aint hard to findin todays music news the ever controversial tupac shakur has
just released another album under the alias makaveli
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only mr shakur but of death row records as well
nas the alleged ring leader of it is furious at tupac
excuse me makavelis verbal assault
on mobb sleep notorius pig and several other new york rappers
jayz from hawaiian sophie fame big little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release

whyd they get this nigga started
tupac rather makaveli was not available for comment

the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
freedom equality then ill yell out

its ya panther power that makes you a star
panther power

my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldnt settle for being a statistic
couldnt survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
in my community think of unity
but when i charged them tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of hard disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy youll be clawed to death
cause ill be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath

how could this be  how could we both love you
now im trapped in this position and dont know what to do
i could forget about you pretend that we never met
but when im here without you i start to heavily sweat
you give me looks that reinforce the bond thats already there
so many times i find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
play the role like you dont matter he swears that we hate each other
but in reality we cant wait to taste each other
youre my addiction casue i fiend for your desperately
i stand here fantasizin because youre next to me
what can i do with this passion i feel
its too hard to conceal so i know its for real
watched you so many times i know where every curve is
i think you reads my mind and so im feelin nervous
i wana tell you how i feel but that wouldnt help
it would only cause problems so i keep to myself
even though it drives me crazy to see you sittin with him
a tear rolls down my cheek because i see you kiss him
i know the words youre sayin before they can be said
hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
wouldnt hurt the brother for anything in this world
but damn i fell in love with his girl  my burnin heart heart heart

well how could he leave me with this temptation
now im confused cause im no casanova
but you keep callin  youre sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
my burnin heart my burnin heart my burnin hearti know this girl and her name is minnie
livin in the projects didnt own a penny
met her at a school dance so i took a chance
walked her to the parkin lot for a little romance
got to my car put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams i was on a mission
i was catchin wild things like the chicken pox
i was j and knockin boots right down the socks
she was freaky and wild oh man could i call it
but when i dropped her off she had stole my wallet
i couldnt quite believe that why a hoochercoocher
but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher
minnie the moocher was a legend on the block im from
a dream girl to many brothers but true to none
her reputation was enormous  a real go getter
and once a brother met her he wanted to get with her
maybe it was her smile her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
but whatever it was minnie the moocher was an expert
real heartbreaker but never get hurt
she had this boyfriend his name was diamond
helpin minnie out with the little social climbin
met with politicians peace to many others
suddenly and instantly they became her lovers
she took the power that they possessed
and minnie did it all without gettin undressed
minnie dissed diamond sayin that he could not live with her
but he wanted payment for the things he did for her
he grabbed the gun sittin on the nightstand
minnie held the bullets put the pistol in her right hand
she was a legend to everyone who knew her
thats is my memory of minnie the moocher
minnie had a boyfriend a gambler
addicted to poker an alcoholic a basshead crack smoker
he took her to harlem and all around chinatown
he bought some bass a pipe a tape of hardrap sounds
she was an addict tired of the static and poverty
sick of the same ghetto misery
see minnie was a young kid lookin for excitement
smokey was a hoodlum headin for inditement
then one day their relationship stopped
when smokey was killed by the miccops
minnie was hurt lost without a clue
to her there was no chance of gettin somebody new
so she walked home sadly as bad as it seems
she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden
he gave her things that this girl was much needin
a plush house made of gold and steel
a diamond car with a platt in the wheel
now you might think this is a lot of stuff
but to minnie this was not enough
he bought a stable full of thoroughbred race horses
his meal she ate was a dozen courses
she had a fortune in nickels and dimes
and she sat around and counted it a billion times
she had bank yeah minnie was clockin
had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin
she would walk by tryin all to wink her eye
then she dissin with zero reply send corrections to the typist
verse    pac 
they finally did it 
they stole the mic i grip

so slip on the slope lets skip on the flow
im fuckin the sluts and hoes
the bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
the gimminy jimminy grows

i love when the crowd says ho
that lets me know they know i can flow
love when they come to my shows
i get up and go with skins before
when im collecting my dough
i never respect the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap
the bigger the check now watch how they sweat

young black maleyou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what the streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big penn
niggas commin out worse offthan when they went in
over the years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get em ill hit em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against the wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was the wrong street
bang bang count another casualty
but its a cop whose shop is brutality
who do you blame its a shame because the mans slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i let em suffer the payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use the phone 
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes the devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was the ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
trapped

all you wanted to be a soulja a soulja

the problem is 
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos

we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back
brothers sistas niggas
when i say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplished nigga
niggas what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight 
fight and die if we must like niggas
this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin better livin
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but were the superior
break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emmancipation proclamation please
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocrisy
the constitution yo it dont apply to me
lady liberty stupid bitch lied to me
steady strong nobodys gonna like what i pumpin
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
im fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
theres much more to life than just poverty
this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika amerikkka  
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people 
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy armed with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
armed with the knowledge of the place we been
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i dont get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day im gonna prove them wrong
not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
theyre pulling your sleave dont believe 
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i cant explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother thats living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took out king

it aint what i expected its hectic its sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
its fate it wasnt my choice to make
to be great im giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
thats why i wrote this song if you ever need me its on
no matter who the foe they must fall
us against them all im down to brawl if my homies callbrendas got a baby
brendas got a baby
i hear brendas got a baby
well brendas barely got a brain
a damn shame
tha girl can hardly spell her name
well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms
and her dad was a junky puttin death into his arm
its sad cause i bet brenda doesnt even know
just cause your in the ghetto doesnt mean ya cant grow
but oh thats a thought my own revelation
do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch the joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who didnt really care to see or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brendas belly is gettin bigger
but no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
shes  years old and shes having a baby
in love with a molester whos sexing her crazy
and yet she thinks that hell be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo
she had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
she didnt know what ta throw away and what to keep
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
she didnt realize how much tha the little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in the trash heep balling
momma cant help her but it hurts to hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away momma say you makin me lose pay
the social workers here everyday
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her family they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now whats next there aint nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
its payin tha rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brendas her name shes got a baby
baaaaaaaabyohh shit  jumped on my mans dick
heard he had a twelve inch now the bitch is lovesick
whos to blame the guy or the groupie

tha lunatic  echoes to fade rebel rebel    rebel
rebel rebel
they just cant stand the reign or the occasional pain
from a man like me who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain so with a little bass and treble
hey mister  its time for me to explain that im the rebel
cold as the devil
straight from the underground the rebel a lower level
they came to see the maniac psychopath
the critics heard of me and the aftermath
i dont give a damn and it shows
and when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me
the lyrical lunatic the maniac emcee
i give a shout out to your homies
and maybe then the criticsll leave your boy alone g
on the streets or on tv
it just dont pay to be a truth tellin mc
they wont be happy till im banned
the most dangerous weapon an educated black man
so point blank in your face pump up the bass
and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cause from the jungle to oaktown they backin me up all the way
you know you gotta love the sound
its from the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground 
now im face to face with the devils
cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
and police brutality
shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
so you reap what you sow
so reap the wrath of the rebel jackin em up once mo
now the fox is in the henhouse creepin up on your daughter
while you sleep i got her sneakin out

ill be nuttin how i wanna and doin what im gonna
now im up to no good
the mastermind of mischief movin more than most could
so sit and slip into the sound
peep the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground 
they say they hate me they wanna hold me down
i guess they scared of the rebel  the rebel of the underground
but i never let it get me
i just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
in fact they tryin to keep me out
try to censor what i say
cause they dont like what im talkin bout
so whats wrong with the media today
got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
but me im comin from the soul
and if it dont go gold my story still gettin told
and that way they cant stop me
and if it sells a couple of copies the punksll try to copy
its sloppy dont even try to
im a slave to the rhythm and im about to fly through
so yo to the people in the ghetto
when ya hear the bass flow go ahead and let go
now everybody wanna gangbang
they talkin street slang but the punks still cant hang
they makin records bout violence 
but when it comes to the real some brothers go silent
it kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin out just to get your record out
but pacalpyse is straight down
so feel the wrath of the rebel  the rebel of the underground

as far as jealousy bein a celebrity
no matter who committed the crime they all yell at me
and the media is greedier than most
you could sell em your soul or theyll be on ya til a niggaz ghost
and everyday i read the paper theres another lie
they show my picture for the crimes of another guy
now hows that for the life of a big shot
a dead cop a law suit a little kid shot

but please dont cry dry your eyes never let up

and when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
and if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
cause sista you dont need him
and i aint tryin to gas ya up i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy 
when brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women do we hate our women
i think its time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we dont well have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man cant make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
aiyyo i remember marvin gaye used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems im headin for tha pen
i try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rainll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know its funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but cant feed the poor
say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
it aint no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we aint meant to survive cause its a setup
and even though youre fed up
huh ya got to keep your head up
and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
cause i think we can make it in fact im sure
and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
you cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because theres too many things for you to deal with
dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
i was given this world i didnt make it
and now my sons getten older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
and its crazy it seems itll never let up but
please you got to keep your head upyo law

and some would say that turned away is all youll get
i just said bet and never let em see me sweat

while nonbelievers were prayin for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well

now these jealous bitches tryin to fade me
i aint goin out id rather blast back

never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
evadin the playa hatin tricks while hittin switches
bitches is badmouth cause brawlin motherfuckers is bold
but yall some hoes the game should be sewed
im sick of psychotic society somebody save me
addicted to drama so even mama couldnt raise me

revenge is the method whenever steppin keep a weapon close
adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails

picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me my pistol posses usin deadly force
in my brain all i can think about is fame

disrespectin the game prayin for punishment and pain

without feelin but will they last or be blasted
hard headed bastard
maybe hell listen in his casket  the aftermath
more bodies being buried  im losing my homies in a hurry
theyre relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my visions blurried
the question is will i live  no one in the world loves me
im headed for danger dont trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever im feelin this anger
dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
its just me against the world baby

verse three pac
with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finaly get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
dont settle for less  even the genius askses questions
be grateful for blessings
dont ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
if im insane its the fame made a brother change
it wasnt nuttin like the game
its just me against the world
	me against the world
	nuttin to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	got me stuck in the game
	its just me against the world
	oahahhhh
	id be ashamed to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
outro pac
heh hahahahahahah
thats right
i know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
remember one thing
through every dark night theres a bright day after that
so no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
keep your head up and handle it
	me against the world i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through the valley of death
i shed so many tears 
please god walk with me 
back in elementary i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dyin breed
inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can you feel me im not livin in the past you wanna last
be tha first to blast remember kato
no longer with us hes deceased
call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
now rest in peace
is there heaven for a g  remember me
so many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
ahh i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now that im strugglin in this business by any means
label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause im cursed im havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse god can you feel me
take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
show me some happiness again im goin blind
i spend my time in this cell aint livin well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail
my life is in denial and when i die 
baptized in eternal fire ill shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now im lost and im weary so many tears
im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a calculated step to bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothin left
there was no mercy on the streets i couldnt rest
im barely standin bout to go to pieces screamin peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just a misery
paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
will i survive til the monin to see the sun
please lord forgive me for my sins cause here i come
lord i suffered through the years  and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord knows i tried been a witness to homicide
seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
brokenhearted as i glance at the chalk line gettin high
this aint the life for me i wanna change
but aint no future right for me im stuck in the game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
disillusioned lately ive been really wantin babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
im hearin noises think she fuckin all my boys cant take no more
im fallin to the floor beggin for the lord to let me in
to heavens door  shed so many tears
lord ive lost so many years and shed so many tears
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears

verse one pac
      
when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought id see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddys the same drama
when things went wrong wed blame mama
i reminice on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and whod think in elementary
heeey i see the penitentiary one day
and runnin from the police thats right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama
i finally understand
for a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
you always was committed
a poor single mother on welfare tell me how ya did it
theres no way i can pay you back
but the plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated

 second and third chorus and dear mama instead of dear mama
verse two pac
now aint nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
he passed away and i didnt cry cause my anger
wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
they say im wrong and im heartless but all along
i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rents due
i hope ya got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin home after work late
youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
ya just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough youre alone
youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus
verse three pac
pour out some liquor and i reminsce cause through the drama
i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that im hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act craaazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
everything will be alright if ya hold on
its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus

and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate its been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard im faced with it im a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
im soon to count the bodies
verse two tupac

dont take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet

of the bomb prophalaks for protection

shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder im just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
im an mc with lyrics thats tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed thats before its ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
theres no escape nah i aint blastin

opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mcs im the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camps under seige and im jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
im out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
verse four method man
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up  wit german 
the mr methtical from staten isle

melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clans three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or thats that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
verse five redman
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
lets face it theres no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit im laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when im splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch dont get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs cant fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you gets lot
with this underground cannabis
im dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lps
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
im the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope

heaven aint hard to findin todays music news the ever controversial tupac shakur has
just released another album under the alias makaveli
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only mr shakur but of death row records as well
nas the alleged ring leader of it is furious at tupac
excuse me makavelis verbal assault
on mobb sleep notorius pig and several other new york rappers
jayz from hawaiian sophie fame big little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release

	as we forgive our debtors
	lead us not into temptation
	but deliver us unevil
	for god is the kingdom and the power
	and the glory forever and ever and everin the life we live as thugs
everbody fuckin wit us so cant you see

where are we now guns found daily the feds surely hope
that they could finally nail me for sellin dope

aplogizies to my true sisters far from bitches
help me raise my black nation reperations are due its true
caught up in this world i took advantage of you
so tell the babies how i love them precious boys and girls
born black in this white mans world  and all i heard was

in this world where everyones blind
and where to go no matter how far ill find
to let you know that youre not alone
only thing they ever did wrong 
was bein born black in this white mans world 
  
all my little black seeds born black in this white mans world

cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom education equality
never gave me nothing but slavery
and now look at how dangerous you made me
calling me a mad man cause im strong and bold
with this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
promise me emancipation indispute nation
all you gave my people was our patience
fathers of our country never cared for me
they kept my answer shackled up in slavery
and uncle sam never did a dam thing for me
except lie about the facts in my history
so now im sitting hear mad cause im unemployed
but the governments glad cause they enjoyed
when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power
panther power
panther power
panther power
coming straight that resides within
go toe to toe with a panther and you just cant win
suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
freedom equality then ill yell out
dont you ever be ashamed of what you are
its ya panther power that makes you a star
panther power
panther power
panther power
panther power
my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldnt settle for being a statistic
couldnt survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
in my community think of unity
but when i charged them tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of hard disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy youll be clawed to death
cause ill be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
do you remember that is what im asking you
you think you living free dont let me laugh at you
open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
said you wasnt civilized and stole your name
cause some time has passed seem you all forget
there aint no liberty to you and me we all aint free yet
panter power
panther power
panther power
panther power
as real as it seems the american dream
aint nothing but another calculated schemes
to get us locked up shot up back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names
kept my history of mystery but now i see
the american dream wasnt meant for me
cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom education equality

when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power send corrections to the typist
pac 
they finally did it 
they stole the mic i grip
now that its gone 
im feelin tired and sick
 i dont know i wasnt sleepin that long
when i woke up 
my microphone was gone
first i paniced 
i put the cops on the case
but they was stumped 
without a clue or a trace
so as sure a smoking cigarettes is bad for your health
if i want my microphone back ill find it myself
so i picked up the phone 
i called dizzy 
my mics gone 
lets get busy
before i told dizzy what i wanted to do
he was over at my house with the tms crew
he said word is out on every mouth on the street
now that its gone its not long til your beat
and then it hit me 
i got a battle at 
with out my microphone
im guaranteed to get whipped
ya might think its unbelievable
but word to the strength
when it comes to rockin rhymes
im a musical nimth
they gave me other mics
but yo it wasnt no use
i tried to rock it 
but i couldnt get loose
i said forget it
ya microphone or not
and i got to do this
give it all that i got 
itd be the first time i lost
but if i beat em itd finally prove that im the boss
i grabbed my leather jacket
walked through the streets
was hopin and payin
strictly dope wont get beat
i begin to get hyped
i was ready to fight
yo i was confident that i win
to hell with the mic
i hop on to the stage
dizzy started the beat
the sucka shivered
because he tasted defeat
then i signaled to dizzy
bust a rhyme wit my head
perpetrator fell back 
and then he was dead
i was happy as hell
cause i was lucky that night
put my hand in my pocket
and there was my mic
hahalet knowledge drop
why should i be forced to play dumb
i know where i came from so im going to claim some
but rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
stop think of the past the brothers that die for
sucker to try for never to cry more
tricks to hold his back but well see at the end
hes a fake not a friend
so hes thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
yo hes a trick so he sold his soul for gold
now i know the reason we must excel
cause if we dont well end up in the cell
move on be strong with unity
cause thats the only way to build communities
lies are told but yo lives must move on
and never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
yo im running so i refuse to stop
get sweated by them sell out cops
and i wink cause i pin the opposition
im on a mission to preach and teach to reach
so listen up to the flavor i gave you now dropping it
we folks know ballers know no stopping it
dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
i got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm 
for the simple fact that im black and educated
proud of who am i and you hated
so all i have tried for this many have die for this
you see it and you hear it and you loving it
now you buying this always keep your head look to the mountain top
aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
suckers suffocate when i hype this because you can write this
you constantly bite this
thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
caught with the dope dose
now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
cause you building a boom force
like what you hearing so your checking with the source
tupac brother with the rhymes to rock on
dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
im not conceited but defeated i wont be
as long as theres dope beats ill never be lonely stop
and let me breathe a minute
aiyyo dizzy whats up put the base back in it
let knowledge drop 
by any means neccessary its kind of scary
knowledge of the hands of adversaries
makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
i was waiting for a present god gave me a goal
i refuse to be busting like a sucker for im fighting like a titan
and run you down like a truck
ill take a chance i vote for rock can see
not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
knowledge appealed to me
pay backs a mutha if you steal from me
the bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
and knowledge drops
drop that 
let knowledge drop

but im the veteran the veteran goin like a troop
try to stop me you cant you puff and you pant

winners all over we tried to leave the scene
but theres a whole crowd of people at the limousine
pen and paper in my face i couldnt be mean

teenage terror no room for error

risin like inflation on your favorite station
rap is my forte and my recreation
girls wanna kiss me suckers wanna diss me
my mother didnt want me to be but ima emcee
the ladies desire emcees admire
thats why many hate me and call me liar
hoods of the hypetip girls on the illtrip

i am the high type my style is so right
its not hard to understand its just a day in the lifei lay awake tonight because i wanna be with you
if you were beside me id playfully kiss you
each time i see ya the feelin gets stronger
you sit a bit closer we stare a lot longer
huh  reach for my drink and for a second we touch
words are muttered i stutter cause i want you that much
the situation is a nowin cause hes my best friend
but now im guilty of fallin for his girlfriend
i know its wrong but my heart is filled with purity
i offer passion but he offers security
its like a trap that im sinkin into
i wake up sweaty when im sleepin cause im thinkin of you
then we make eye contact and i cant hold back
i try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
what have i gotten into i feel posessed by you
i have these thoughts at night of undressin you
its kinda obvious blind men might see it
but he doesnt so he keeps on trustin me
leaves me alone wit you while hes on vacation
well how could he leave me with this temptation
now im confused cause im no casanova
but you keep callin  youre sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
girl you are my one and only
you are my angel and now ya wanna leave me lonely
what did i do  baby did i treat you bad
my heart is broken and now ya make me sad
i remember when this love affair first started
we was so in love and now we are departed
girl ill buy ya anything ya heart desires
i have to let ya know baby youre my fire
warm and wet each kiss is prolonged
its your sweet caress that makes rock t strong
just bein with you and seein the two of us

hes my best friend but i cant help clockin you
how could this be  how could we both love you
now im trapped in this position and dont know what to do
i could forget about you pretend that we never met
but when im here without you i start to heavily sweat
you give me looks that reinforce the bond thats already there
so many times i find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
play the role like you dont matter he swears that we hate each other
but in reality we cant wait to taste each other
youre my addiction casue i fiend for your desperately
i stand here fantasizin because youre next to me
what can i do with this passion i feel
its too hard to conceal so i know its for real
watched you so many times i know where every curve is
i think you reads my mind and so im feelin nervous
i wana tell you how i feel but that wouldnt help
it would only cause problems so i keep to myself
even though it drives me crazy to see you sittin with him
a tear rolls down my cheek because i see you kiss him
i know the words youre sayin before they can be said
hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
wouldnt hurt the brother for anything in this world
but damn i fell in love with his girl  my burnin heart heart heart
my heart is burnin ya know its yearin for ya sweet caress
i lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
you know ya love me why must you deny yourself
what i can offer you yet you want somebody else

i hope im good for you cause baby youre so good for me
many nights i cried and tried to make this work
then act the fool and cool and cruel like the church
well im sorry baby i have to let you know

you are so beautiful baby you light up my life
i close my eyes and dream of that youll become my wife
day in and day out its you i pray about

i love you cause honey youre like a work of art
you got me on fire  my burnin heart
i lay awake tonight because i wanna be with you
if you were beside me id playfully kiss you
each time i see ya the feelin gets stronger

well how could he leave me with this temptation
now im confused cause im no casanova
but you keep callin  youre sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
my burnin heart my burnin heart my burnin hearti know this girl and her name is minnie
livin in the projects didnt own a penny
met her at a school dance so i took a chance
walked her to the parkin lot for a little romance
got to my car put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams i was on a mission
i was catchin wild things like the chicken pox
i was j and knockin boots right down the socks
she was freaky and wild oh man could i call it
but when i dropped her off she had stole my wallet
i couldnt quite believe that why a hoochercoocher
but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher
minnie the moocher was a legend on the block im from
a dream girl to many brothers but true to none
her reputation was enormous  a real go getter
and once a brother met her he wanted to get with her
maybe it was her smile her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
but whatever it was minnie the moocher was an expert
real heartbreaker but never get hurt
she had this boyfriend his name was diamond
helpin minnie out with the little social climbin
met with politicians peace to many others
suddenly and instantly they became her lovers
she took the power that they possessed
and minnie did it all without gettin undressed
minnie dissed diamond sayin that he could not live with her
but he wanted payment for the things he did for her
he grabbed the gun sittin on the nightstand
minnie held the bullets put the pistol in her right hand
she was a legend to everyone who knew her
thats is my memory of minnie the moocher
minnie had a boyfriend a gambler
addicted to poker an alcoholic a basshead crack smoker
he took her to harlem and all around chinatown
he bought some bass a pipe a tape of hardrap sounds
she was an addict tired of the static and poverty
sick of the same ghetto misery
see minnie was a young kid lookin for excitement
smokey was a hoodlum headin for inditement
then one day their relationship stopped
when smokey was killed by the miccops
minnie was hurt lost without a clue
to her there was no chance of gettin somebody new
so she walked home sadly as bad as it seems
she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden
he gave her things that this girl was much needin
a plush house made of gold and steel
a diamond car with a platt in the wheel
now you might think this is a lot of stuff
but to minnie this was not enough
he bought a stable full of thoroughbred race horses
his meal she ate was a dozen courses
she had a fortune in nickels and dimes
and she sat around and counted it a billion times
she had bank yeah minnie was clockin
had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin
she would walk by tryin all to wink her eye
then she dissin with zero reply send corrections to the typist
verse    pac 
they finally did it 
they stole the mic i grip
now that its gone 
im feelin tired and sick
 i dont know i wasnt sleepin that long
when i woke up 
my microphone was gone
first i paniced 
i put the cops on the case
but they was stumped 
without a clue or a trace
so as sure a smoking cigarettes is bad for your health
if i want my microphone back ill do it my self
so i picked up the phone 
i called dizzy 
my mics gone 
lets get busy
before i told dizzy what i wanted to do
he was over at my house with the tms crew
he said word is out on every mouth on the street
now that its gone its not long til your beat
and then it hit me 
i got a battle at 
with out my microphone
im guaranteed to get whipped
ya might think its unbelievable
but word to the strength
when it comes to rockin rhymes
im a musical nimth
they gave me other mics
but yo it wasnt no use
i tried to rock it 
but i couldnt get loose
i said forget it
ya microphone or not
and i got to do this
give it all that i got 
itd be the first time i lost
but if i beat em itd finally prove that im the boss
i grabbed my leather jacket
walked through the streets
was hopin and payin
strictly dope wont get beat
i begin to get hyped
i was ready to fight
yo i was confident that i win
to hell with the mic
i hop on to the stage
dizzy started the beat
the sucka shivered
because he tasted defeat
then i signaled to dizzy
bust a rhyme wit my head
perpetrator fell back 
and then he was dead
i was happy as hell
cause i was lucky that night
put my hand in my pocket
and there was my mic
haha

cause i aint a crook despite how i look
i dont sell llello
theyre judging a brother like covers and books
follow me into a flow
im sure you know which way to go
im hittin em out of the dopes
so slip on the slope lets skip on the flow
im fuckin the sluts and hoes
the bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
the gimminy jimminy grows
then whaddya know its off with some clothes
i love when the crowd says ho
that lets me know they know i can flow
love when they come to my shows
i get up and go with skins before
when im collecting my dough
i never respect the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap
the bigger the check now watch how they sweat
what kind of style is that
the style of a mack and ready to jack

        we gonna say who the big mouth when i come back
young black maleyou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what the streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big penn
niggas commin out worse offthan when they went in
over the years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get em ill hit em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against the wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was the wrong street
bang bang count another casualty
but its a cop whose shop is brutality
who do you blame its a shame because the mans slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i let em suffer the payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use the phone 
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes the devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was the ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
trapped 
all you wanted to be a soulja a soulja
all you wanted to be a soulja like me
all you wanted to be a soulja a soulja
all you wanted to be a soulja like me

the problem is 
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos

we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back
brothers sistas niggas
when i say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplished nigga
niggas what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight 
fight and die if we must like niggas
this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin better livin
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but were the superior
break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emmancipation proclamation please
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocrisy
the constitution yo it dont apply to me
lady liberty stupid bitch lied to me
steady strong nobodys gonna like what i pumpin
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
im fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
theres much more to life than just poverty
this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika amerikkka  
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people 
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy armed with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
armed with the knowledge of the place we been
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i dont get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day im gonna prove them wrong
not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
theyre pulling your sleave dont believe

forgeting your brother thats living her apology

we been coochiecoo all through school you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasnt
but like the old saying goes
time goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope gaaaame my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with aks
and though i been around clowning with the underground
im still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for yall if my homies call
its a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang caine on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo caine
you got fame now you run with no shame
i chose rap tracks to make stacks

but life makin records aint easy

trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
its fate it wasnt my choice to make
to be great im giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong

in love with a molester whos sexing her crazy
and yet she thinks that hell be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo
she had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
she didnt know what ta throw away and what to keep
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
she didnt realize how much tha the little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in the trash heep balling
momma cant help her but it hurts to hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away momma say you makin me lose pay
the social workers here everyday
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her family they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now whats next there aint nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
its payin tha rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brendas her name shes got a baby

from a man like me who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain so with a little bass and treble
hey mister  its time for me to explain that im the rebel
cold as the devil
straight from the underground the rebel a lower level
they came to see the maniac psychopath
the critics heard of me and the aftermath
i dont give a damn and it shows
and when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me
the lyrical lunatic the maniac emcee
i give a shout out to your homies
and maybe then the criticsll leave your boy alone g
on the streets or on tv
it just dont pay to be a truth tellin mc
they wont be happy till im banned
the most dangerous weapon an educated black man
so point blank in your face pump up the bass
and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cause from the jungle to oaktown they backin me up all the way
you know you gotta love the sound
its from the rebel  the rebel of the underground

and uhh i know they like to beat ya down a lot
when you come around the block brothas clown a lot
but please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
and when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
and if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
cause sista you dont need him
and i aint tryin to gas ya up i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy 
when brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women do we hate our women
i think its time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we dont well have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man cant make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
aiyyo i remember marvin gaye used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems im headin for tha pen
i try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rainll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know its funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but cant feed the poor
say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
it aint no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we aint meant to survive cause its a setup
and even though youre fed up
huh ya got to keep your head up
and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
cause i think we can make it in fact im sure
and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
you cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because theres too many things for you to deal with
dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
i was given this world i didnt make it
and now my sons getten older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
and its crazy it seems itll never let up but
please you got to keep your head upyo law
is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one
yeah  mr fuckacop is back
and i still dont give a fuck yaknahmsayin
puffin on this indo in the studio with my partners out here
pacific heights in the house know what i mean
   
i was framed so dont make the same mistake nigga
you gotta learn how to shake the snakes nigga
cause the police love to break a nigga

and some would say that turned away is all youll get
i just said bet and never let em see me sweat

while nonbelievers were prayin for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart im knowin that they wish me hell

and if you drop at least you know you gave your all

revenge is the method whenever steppin keep a weapon close
adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails
hit the block and fill your pockets makin crack sales
picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me my pistol posses usin deadly force
in my brain all i can think about is fame

im seein cemetary photos of my peers

chorus
pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
plottin on murderin motherfuckers fore they get you

a stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
pissin while practicin how to pimp and be a playa
overdose of a dick while drinkin liquor when i lay her
pistol whippin these simps for bein petrified and lame
disrespectin the game prayin for punishment and pain
goin insane never die live eternal who shall i fear
dont shed a tear for me nigga i aint happy hear

without feelin but will they last or be blasted
hard headed bastard
maybe hell listen in his casket  the aftermath
more bodies being buried  im losing my homies in a hurry
theyre relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my visions blurried
the question is will i live  no one in the world loves me
im headed for danger dont trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever im feelin this anger
dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	its just me against the world
	ooooh yeah ooohooo

verse two dramacydal

verse three pac
with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finaly get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
dont settle for less  even the genius askses questions
be grateful for blessings
dont ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
if im insane its the fame made a brother change
it wasnt nuttin like the game
its just me against the world
	me against the world
	nuttin to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	got me stuck in the game
	its just me against the world
	oahahhhh
	id be ashamed to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
outro pac
heh hahahahahahah
thats right
i know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
remember one thing
through every dark night theres a bright day after that
so no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
keep your head up and handle it
	me against the world i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through the valley of death
i shed so many tears 
please god walk with me 
back in elementary i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dyin breed
inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can you feel me im not livin in the past you wanna last
be tha first to blast remember kato
no longer with us hes deceased
call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
now rest in peace
is there heaven for a g  remember me
so many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
ahh i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now that im strugglin in this business by any means
label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause im cursed im havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse god can you feel me
take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
show me some happiness again im goin blind
i spend my time in this cell aint livin well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail
my life is in denial and when i die 
baptized in eternal fire ill shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now im lost and im weary so many tears
im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a calculated step to bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothin left
there was no mercy on the streets i couldnt rest
im barely standin bout to go to pieces screamin peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just a misery
paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
will i survive til the monin to see the sun
please lord forgive me for my sins cause here i come
lord i suffered through the years  and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord knows i tried been a witness to homicide
seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
brokenhearted as i glance at the chalk line gettin high
this aint the life for me i wanna change
but aint no future right for me im stuck in the game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
disillusioned lately ive been really wantin babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
im hearin noises think she fuckin all my boys cant take no more
im fallin to the floor beggin for the lord to let me in
to heavens door  shed so many tears

verse one pac
      
when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought id see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddys the same drama
when things went wrong wed blame mama
i reminice on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and whod think in elementary
heeey i see the penitentiary one day
and runnin from the police thats right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama

they say im wrong and im heartless but all along
i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rents due
i hope ya got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin home after work late
youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
ya just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough youre alone
youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus
verse three pac
pour out some liquor and i reminsce cause through the drama
i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that im hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act craaazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
everything will be alright if ya hold on
its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated

i can see youre cautious and im careful not to scare you
but anticipation of love makin 
got you shakin when im standin near you

now the pictures getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
i tell you to leave him and you tell me keep my faith in god

who can withstand the mo power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate its been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard im faced with it im a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
im soon to count the bodies
verse two tupac

im bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
dont take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet

verse three kurupt

of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin sac wont collapse

sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mcs
shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder im just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
im an mc with lyrics thats tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed thats before its ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
theres no escape nah i aint blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mcs im the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camps under seige and im jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
im out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
verse four method man
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up  wit german 
the mr methtical from staten isle
will be back after this message dont touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice

melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clans three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or thats that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
verse five redman
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
lets face it theres no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit im laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when im splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch dont get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs cant fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you gets lot
with this underground cannabis
im dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lps
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
im the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee  coly

after a long day of tryin to make my songs pay

heaven aint hard to find
heaven aint hard to findin todays music news the ever controversial tupac shakur has
just released another album under the alias makaveli
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only mr shakur but of death row records as well
nas the alleged ring leader of it is furious at tupac
excuse me makavelis verbal assault
on mobb sleep notorius pig and several other new york rappers
jayz from hawaiian sophie fame big little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release

aplogizies to my true sisters far from bitches
help me raise my black nation reperations are due its true
caught up in this world i took advantage of you
so tell the babies how i love them precious boys and girls
born black in this white mans world  and all i heard was
who knows what tomorrow brings
in this world where everyones blind
and where to go no matter how far ill find
to let you know that youre not alone
only thing they ever did wrong 
was bein born black in this white mans world 
  
all my little black seeds born black in this white mans world

the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
freedom equality then ill yell out
dont you ever be ashamed of what you are
its ya panther power that makes you a star
panther power
panther power

my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldnt settle for being a statistic
couldnt survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
in my community think of unity
but when i charged them tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of hard disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy youll be clawed to death
cause ill be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath

im feelin tired and sick
 i dont know i wasnt sleepin that long
when i woke up 
my microphone was gone
first i paniced 
i put the cops on the case
but they was stumped 
without a clue or a trace
so as sure a smoking cigarettes is bad for your health
if i want my microphone back ill find it myself
so i picked up the phone 
i called dizzy 
my mics gone 
lets get busy
before i told dizzy what i wanted to do
he was over at my house with the tms crew
he said word is out on every mouth on the street
now that its gone its not long til your beat
and then it hit me 
i got a battle at 
with out my microphone
im guaranteed to get whipped
ya might think its unbelievable
but word to the strength
when it comes to rockin rhymes
im a musical nimth
they gave me other mics
but yo it wasnt no use
i tried to rock it 
but i couldnt get loose
i said forget it
ya microphone or not
and i got to do this
give it all that i got 
itd be the first time i lost
but if i beat em itd finally prove that im the boss
i grabbed my leather jacket
walked through the streets
was hopin and payin
strictly dope wont get beat
i begin to get hyped
i was ready to fight
yo i was confident that i win
to hell with the mic
i hop on to the stage
dizzy started the beat
the sucka shivered
because he tasted defeat
then i signaled to dizzy
bust a rhyme wit my head
perpetrator fell back 
and then he was dead
i was happy as hell
cause i was lucky that night
put my hand in my pocket
and there was my mic

why should i be forced to play dumb
i know where i came from so im going to claim some
but rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
stop think of the past the brothers that die for
sucker to try for never to cry more
tricks to hold his back but well see at the end
hes a fake not a friend
so hes thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
yo hes a trick so he sold his soul for gold
now i know the reason we must excel
cause if we dont well end up in the cell
move on be strong with unity
cause thats the only way to build communities
lies are told but yo lives must move on
and never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop
drop that 
let knowledge drop
yo im running so i refuse to stop
get sweated by them sell out cops
and i wink cause i pin the opposition
im on a mission to preach and teach to reach
so listen up to the flavor i gave you now dropping it
we folks know ballers know no stopping it
dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
i got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm 
for the simple fact that im black and educated
proud of who am i and you hated
so all i have tried for this many have die for this
you see it and you hear it and you loving it
now you buying this always keep your head look to the mountain top
aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop

suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me

as long as theres dope beats ill never be lonely stop
and let me breathe a minute
aiyyo dizzy whats up put the base back in it

hes my best friend but i cant help clockin you
how could this be  how could we both love you
now im trapped in this position and dont know what to do
i could forget about you pretend that we never met
but when im here without you i start to heavily sweat
you give me looks that reinforce the bond thats already there
so many times i find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
play the role like you dont matter he swears that we hate each other
but in reality we cant wait to taste each other
youre my addiction casue i fiend for your desperately
i stand here fantasizin because youre next to me
what can i do with this passion i feel
its too hard to conceal so i know its for real
watched you so many times i know where every curve is
i think you reads my mind and so im feelin nervous
i wana tell you how i feel but that wouldnt help
it would only cause problems so i keep to myself
even though it drives me crazy to see you sittin with him
a tear rolls down my cheek because i see you kiss him
i know the words youre sayin before they can be said
hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
wouldnt hurt the brother for anything in this world
but damn i fell in love with his girl  my burnin heart heart heart
my heart is burnin ya know its yearin for ya sweet caress
i lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
you know ya love me why must you deny yourself
what i can offer you yet you want somebody else

but you keep callin  youre sayin to come over
what do i do  go or stay and play it smart
its gettin rougher cause i suffer from a burnin heart
my burnin heart
my burnin heart my burnin heart my burnin hearti know this girl and her name is minnie
livin in the projects didnt own a penny
met her at a school dance so i took a chance
walked her to the parkin lot for a little romance
got to my car put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams i was on a mission
i was catchin wild things like the chicken pox
i was j and knockin boots right down the socks
she was freaky and wild oh man could i call it
but when i dropped her off she had stole my wallet
i couldnt quite believe that why a hoochercoocher
but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher
minnie the moocher was a legend on the block im from
a dream girl to many brothers but true to none
her reputation was enormous  a real go getter
and once a brother met her he wanted to get with her
maybe it was her smile her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
but whatever it was minnie the moocher was an expert
real heartbreaker but never get hurt
she had this boyfriend his name was diamond
helpin minnie out with the little social climbin
met with politicians peace to many others
suddenly and instantly they became her lovers
she took the power that they possessed
and minnie did it all without gettin undressed
minnie dissed diamond sayin that he could not live with her
but he wanted payment for the things he did for her
he grabbed the gun sittin on the nightstand
minnie held the bullets put the pistol in her right hand
she was a legend to everyone who knew her
thats is my memory of minnie the moocher
minnie had a boyfriend a gambler
addicted to poker an alcoholic a basshead crack smoker
he took her to harlem and all around chinatown
he bought some bass a pipe a tape of hardrap sounds
she was an addict tired of the static and poverty
sick of the same ghetto misery
see minnie was a young kid lookin for excitement
smokey was a hoodlum headin for inditement
then one day their relationship stopped
when smokey was killed by the miccops
minnie was hurt lost without a clue
to her there was no chance of gettin somebody new
so she walked home sadly as bad as it seems
she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden
he gave her things that this girl was much needin
a plush house made of gold and steel
a diamond car with a platt in the wheel
now you might think this is a lot of stuff
but to minnie this was not enough
he bought a stable full of thoroughbred race horses
his meal she ate was a dozen courses
she had a fortune in nickels and dimes
and she sat around and counted it a billion times
she had bank yeah minnie was clockin
had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin
she would walk by tryin all to wink her eye
then she dissin with zero reply send corrections to the typist
verse    pac 
they finally did it

im feelin tired and sick

itd be the first time i lost
but if i beat em itd finally prove that im the boss
i grabbed my leather jacket
walked through the streets
was hopin and payin
strictly dope wont get beat
i begin to get hyped
i was ready to fight
yo i was confident that i win
to hell with the mic
i hop on to the stage
dizzy started the beat
the sucka shivered
because he tasted defeat
then i signaled to dizzy
bust a rhyme wit my head
perpetrator fell back 
and then he was dead
i was happy as hell
cause i was lucky that night
put my hand in my pocket
and there was my mic
haha

theyre judging a brother like covers and books
follow me into a flow
im sure you know which way to go
im hittin em out of the dopes
so slip on the slope lets skip on the flow
im fuckin the sluts and hoes
the bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
the gimminy jimminy grows
then whaddya know its off with some clothes
i love when the crowd says ho
that lets me know they know i can flow
love when they come to my shows
i get up and go with skins before
when im collecting my dough
i never respect the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap
the bigger the check now watch how they sweat
what kind of style is that
the style of a mack and ready to jack

young black maleyou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what the streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big penn
niggas commin out worse offthan when they went in
over the years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get em ill hit em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against the wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was the wrong street
bang bang count another casualty
but its a cop whose shop is brutality
who do you blame its a shame because the mans slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i let em suffer the payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use the phone 
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes the devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was the ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
trapped 
all you wanted to be a soulja a soulja
all you wanted to be a soulja like me
all you wanted to be a soulja a soulja

at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back

it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplished nigga

break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emmancipation proclamation please
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocrisy
the constitution yo it dont apply to me
lady liberty stupid bitch lied to me
steady strong nobodys gonna like what i pumpin
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
im fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
theres much more to life than just poverty
this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika amerikkka  
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people 
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy armed with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
armed with the knowledge of the place we been
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i dont get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day im gonna prove them wrong
not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
theyre pulling your sleave dont believe 
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i cant explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother thats living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took out king

we been coochiecoo all through school you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasnt
but like the old saying goes
time goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope gaaaame my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with aks
and though i been around clowning with the underground
im still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for yall if my homies call
its a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang caine on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo caine
you got fame now you run with no shame
i chose rap tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i dont wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go youre not lowly
and i hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me call
if you need my assistance therell be no resistance
ill be there in an instant
who am i to judge another brother only on his cover
id be no different than the others
htotheotothemtotheitothee
im down to the end
cause its a fall in no time at all
im down for yall when my homies call
word if my homies call
well its ninetyone and im livin kinda swell now
but i hear that youre going through some hell pal
but life makin records aint easy
it aint what i expected its hectic its sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
its fate it wasnt my choice to make
to be great im giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
thats why i wrote this song if you ever need me its on
no matter who the foe they must fall
us against them all im down to brawl if my homies callbrendas got a baby
brendas got a baby
i hear brendas got a baby
well brendas barely got a brain
a damn shame
tha girl can hardly spell her name
well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms
and her dad was a junky puttin death into his arm
its sad cause i bet brenda doesnt even know
just cause your in the ghetto doesnt mean ya cant grow
but oh thats a thought my own revelation
do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch the joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who didnt really care to see or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brendas belly is gettin bigger
but no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
shes  years old and shes having a baby
in love with a molester whos sexing her crazy
and yet she thinks that hell be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo
she had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
she didnt know what ta throw away and what to keep
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
she didnt realize how much tha the little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in the trash heep balling
momma cant help her but it hurts to hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away momma say you makin me lose pay
the social workers here everyday
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her family they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now whats next there aint nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
its payin tha rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brendas her name shes got a baby
baaaaaaaabyohh shit  jumped on my mans dick
heard he had a twelve inch now the bitch is lovesick
whos to blame the guy or the groupie

tha lunatic  echoes to fade rebel rebel    rebel
rebel rebel
they just cant stand the reign or the occasional pain
from a man like me who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain so with a little bass and treble
hey mister  its time for me to explain that im the rebel
cold as the devil
straight from the underground the rebel a lower level
they came to see the maniac psychopath
the critics heard of me and the aftermath
i dont give a damn and it shows
and when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me
the lyrical lunatic the maniac emcee
i give a shout out to your homies
and maybe then the criticsll leave your boy alone g
on the streets or on tv
it just dont pay to be a truth tellin mc
they wont be happy till im banned
the most dangerous weapon an educated black man
so point blank in your face pump up the bass
and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cause from the jungle to oaktown they backin me up all the way
you know you gotta love the sound
its from the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground 
now im face to face with the devils
cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
and police brutality
shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
so you reap what you sow
so reap the wrath of the rebel jackin em up once mo
now the fox is in the henhouse creepin up on your daughter
while you sleep i got her sneakin out
tupac aint nuttin nice
ill be nuttin how i wanna and doin what im gonna
now im up to no good
the mastermind of mischief movin more than most could
so sit and slip into the sound
peep the rebel  the rebel of the underground
rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground 
they say they hate me they wanna hold me down
i guess they scared of the rebel  the rebel of the underground
but i never let it get me
i just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
in fact they tryin to keep me out
try to censor what i say
cause they dont like what im talkin bout
so whats wrong with the media today
got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
but me im comin from the soul
and if it dont go gold my story still gettin told
and that way they cant stop me
and if it sells a couple of copies the punksll try to copy
its sloppy dont even try to
im a slave to the rhythm and im about to fly through
so yo to the people in the ghetto
when ya hear the bass flow go ahead and let go
now everybody wanna gangbang
they talkin street slang but the punks still cant hang
they makin records bout violence 
but when it comes to the real some brothers go silent
it kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin out just to get your record out
but pacalpyse is straight down
so feel the wrath of the rebel  the rebel of the underground

when you come around the block brothas clown a lot
but please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
and when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
and if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
cause sista you dont need him
and i aint tryin to gas ya up i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy 
when brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women do we hate our women
i think its time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we dont well have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man cant make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
aiyyo i remember marvin gaye used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems im headin for tha pen
i try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rainll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know its funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but cant feed the poor
say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
it aint no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we aint meant to survive cause its a setup
and even though youre fed up
huh ya got to keep your head up
and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
cause i think we can make it in fact im sure
and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
you cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because theres too many things for you to deal with
dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
i was given this world i didnt make it
and now my sons getten older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
and its crazy it seems itll never let up but
please you got to keep your head upyo law

i never tripped though  always kept my head up high
eventually i knew that i would find my way
after the darkest night always comes a brighter day
and some would say that turned away is all youll get
i just said bet and never let em see me sweat
cause in the end i knew that i would have it all
while nonbelievers were prayin for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart im knowin that they wish me hell
yo get a real job rappin doesnt pay the rent
i hate the studio cause thats where all my money went
never surrender its all about the faith youve got
dont ever stop just push it til you hit the top
and if you drop at least you know you gave your all
be true to you and that way you can never fall
but beware these backstabbers aint no joke
just like a rope they hang on you until youre broke
and when youre broke they move onto the next dope
and there you are cant even pay your car nope
and when you reminisce thinkin how you got dissed
remember how it felt and then remember this
be true to you believe that theres no one bigger

instead of takin care of me hed rather live lavishly
thats why ill never be a father
unless you got the time its a crime dont even bother

adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails

picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me my pistol posses usin deadly force

addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
without feelin but will they last or be blasted
hard headed bastard
maybe hell listen in his casket  the aftermath
more bodies being buried  im losing my homies in a hurry
theyre relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my visions blurried
the question is will i live  no one in the world loves me
im headed for danger dont trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever im feelin this anger
dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	its just me against the world
	ooooh yeah ooohooo
	its just me against the world
	me against the world

verse two dramacydal

verse three pac
with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finaly get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
dont settle for less  even the genius askses questions
be grateful for blessings
dont ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
if im insane its the fame made a brother change
it wasnt nuttin like the game
its just me against the world
	me against the world
	nuttin to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
	got me stuck in the game
	its just me against the world
	oahahhhh
	id be ashamed to lose
	its just me against the world baby
	me against the world
outro pac
heh hahahahahahah
thats right
i know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
remember one thing
through every dark night theres a bright day after that
so no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
keep your head up and handle it
	me against the world i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through the valley of death
i shed so many tears 
please god walk with me 
back in elementary i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dyin breed
inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can you feel me im not livin in the past you wanna last
be tha first to blast remember kato
no longer with us hes deceased
call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
now rest in peace
is there heaven for a g  remember me
so many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
ahh i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now that im strugglin in this business by any means
label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause im cursed im havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse god can you feel me
take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
show me some happiness again im goin blind
i spend my time in this cell aint livin well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail
my life is in denial and when i die 
baptized in eternal fire ill shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears
lord i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
now im lost and im weary so many tears
im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a calculated step to bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothin left
there was no mercy on the streets i couldnt rest
im barely standin bout to go to pieces screamin peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just a misery
paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
will i survive til the monin to see the sun
please lord forgive me for my sins cause here i come
lord i suffered through the years  and shed so many tears
god i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord knows i tried been a witness to homicide
seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
brokenhearted as i glance at the chalk line gettin high
this aint the life for me i wanna change
but aint no future right for me im stuck in the game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
disillusioned lately ive been really wantin babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
im hearin noises think she fuckin all my boys cant take no more
im fallin to the floor beggin for the lord to let me in
to heavens door  shed so many tears
lord ive lost so many years and shed so many tears
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
lord i suffered through the years and shed so many tears

verse one pac
      
when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought id see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddys the same drama
when things went wrong wed blame mama
i reminice on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and whod think in elementary
heeey i see the penitentiary one day
and runnin from the police thats right

verse two pac
now aint nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
he passed away and i didnt cry cause my anger
wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
they say im wrong and im heartless but all along
i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rents due
i hope ya got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin home after work late
youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
ya just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin
but now the road got rough youre alone
youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus
verse three pac
pour out some liquor and i reminsce cause through the drama
i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that im hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act craaazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
everything will be alright if ya hold on
its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated
chorus

who can withstand the mo power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate its been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard im faced with it im a ride
breakin in gas with the sixeight all day
in and out with my pay
im soon to count the bodies
verse two tupac

dont take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet

of the bomb prophalaks for protection

shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder im just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
im an mc with lyrics thats tha fuckin bombay
ya got dissed thats before its ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
theres no escape nah i aint blastin

opposed to laughin raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mcs im the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camps under seige and im jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
im out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
verse four method man
fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up  wit german 
the mr methtical from staten isle
will be back after this message dont touch tha dial

melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clans three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for ninenickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or thats that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast
verse five redman
aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
nonbelievers get my dick and genitals backwards
lets face it theres no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit im laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when im splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch dont get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs cant fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you gets lot
with this underground cannabis
im dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lps
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
im the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope

heaven aint hard to findin todays music news the ever controversial tupac shakur has
just released another album under the alias makaveli
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only mr shakur but of death row records as well
nas the alleged ring leader of it is furious at tupac
excuse me makavelis verbal assault
on mobb sleep notorius pig and several other new york rappers
jayz from hawaiian sophie fame big little whatever

thats money over bitches cause they breed envy
now rule two is a hard one watch for phonies
keep yo enemies close nigga watch yo homies

try to find a way to make it out the game
i leave this and hope god can see my heart is pure
is heaven just another door  i leave this here
i leave this and hope god see my heart is pure
is heaven just another door  and my people say
	our father who art in heaven
	hallow be thy name
	thy kingdom come thy will be done
	in earth as it is in heaven
	give us this day our daily bread
	as we give up our debts
	as we forgive our debtors
	lead us not into temptation
	but deliver us unevil
	for god is the kingdom and the power
	and the glory forever and ever and everin the life we live as thugs
everbody fuckin wit us so cant you see
its hard to be a man
ridin wit my gun in hand
why explain the game niggaz aint listenin

have these bustas switchin lookin at me mean
itchin givin suckas plenty space
have these bitch niggaz snitchin
where are we now guns found daily the feds surely hope
that they could finally nail me for sellin dope
they backwards make tracks burst whenever i rap
attack words bein known to explode on contact
extreme at times blinded by my passion and fury
look at me laugh at my competition flashin my jewelry
youd stay silent if you niggaz knew me truly effective
the shit you heard aint do me justice  got a death wish bitch
run up face me and trace wit an infared beam
it seems niggaz aint recognize my team
aint nobody holdin you back explode the track to confetti
unload it cause niggaz aint ready  the life of an outlaw
code three attack formation pull out your pistols
keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin to get you
merciless madman screamin kamikaze in tongue
automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run
who should i call when im shot and bleedin
indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
dope got me hatin fiends scheme with my team just a chosen few
my foes victim of explosives come closer exhale the fumes
we got memories fadin fast a slave for cash
accelerate mash blast then dash
dont look now how you like it raw
niggaz aint ready for the wrath of the outlaws  never surrender
death is for a son to stay free im thugged out
fuck the world cause this is how they made me
scarred but still breathin believe in me and you could see the victory
a warrior with jewels can you picture me life of an outlaw
city under siege its like i cant even breathe
im from the state of car thieves g deep from the street
plenty beef i play for keeps arrange the whole crime scene
mobb deep this nigga from behind tryin to creep
no haps wit no straps jack its on to bounce back
i house a rap so fat they snatch my style off dap
come to grip with hollow tips that getcha

readin love letters late night locked down and quiet
if brothers dont recieve they mail best believe we riot
eatin jackmack starin at walls of silence
inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
in time i learned a few lessons never fall for riches
aplogizies to my true sisters far from bitches
help me raise my black nation reperations are due its true
caught up in this world i took advantage of you
so tell the babies how i love them precious boys and girls
born black in this white mans world  and all i heard was
who knows what tomorrow brings
in this world where everyones blind
and where to go no matter how far ill find
to let you know that youre not alone
only thing they ever did wrong 
was bein born black in this white mans world 
  
all my little black seeds born black in this white mans world
  
  
  
  
bein born with less i must confess only adds on to the stress
