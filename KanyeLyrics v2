well momma i know i act a fool
but ill be gone til november i got packs to move i hope
god show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
the only thing that i pray is that me feet dont fail me now
and i dont think there is nothing i can do now to right my wrongs
i want to talk to god but im afraid because we aint spoke in so long
to the hustlas killers murderers drug dealers even the strippers
to the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
now hear ye hear ye want to see thee more clearly
i know he hear me when my feet get weary
cuz were the almost nearly extinct
we rappers are role models we rap we dont think
i aint here to argue about his facial features
or here to convert atheists into believers
im just trying to say the way school need teachers
the way kathie lee needed regis thats the way yall need jesus
so here go my single dog radio needs this
they say you can rap about anything except for jesus
that means guns sex lies video tapes
but if i talk about god my record wont get played huh
well let this take away from my spins
which will probably take away from my ends
then i hope this take away from my sins
and bring the day that im dreaming about
next time im in the club everybody screaming out
god show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
the only thing that i pray is that me feet dont fail me now
  send corrections to the typist
when it comes to being true at least true to me
one thing i found one thing i found
oh no you never let me down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down

yo first i snatched the streets then i snatched the charts
first i had they ear now i have their heart
rappers came and went ive been here from the start
i seen them put it together watched them take it apart

so when i reload he holds  position
when you hot im hot
and when your feet cold mines is sizzelin

this is not an image this is god given
this is hard livin mixed with crystall sippin
its the most consistent hov

nigga im home on these charts yall niggaz visitin
its hov tradition jeff gordan of rap
im back to claim pole position holla at ya boy
i get down for my grandfather who took my momma
made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
at the tender age of  she was arrested for the sit in
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
now niggaz cant make it to ballads to choose leadership
but we can make it to jacobs and to the dealership
swear i hear new music and i just dont be feelin it
racisms still alive they just be concealin it
but i know they dont want me in the damn club
they even make me show id to get inside of sams club
i done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
swear ive been baptized each  or  times
but in the land where niggaz praise yukons and getting paid
its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
nothing sad as that day my girls father past away
so i promised to mr rany im gonna marry your daughter
and you know i gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you see the car i bought her
you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
but i cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
cuz look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watchin me from the other side
we are all here for a reason on a particular path
you dont need a curriculum to know that youre apart of the math
cats think im delirious but im so damn serious
thats why i expose my soul to the globe the world
im tryna make it better for these little boys and girls
im not just another individual
my spirit is a part of this thats why its spiritual
but i get my hymns from him
so its not me its he thats lyrical
im not a miracle im a heaven sent instrument
my rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
for your soul and your mental
thats why im instrumental vibrations is what im into
yeah i need my loot by rent day
but that aint what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
im tryna give us us free like sinke
i cant stop thats why im hot
determination dedication motivation
im talking to you of my many inspirations
when i say i cant let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
and if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
in my grip i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it be known that gods penmanship has been signed
with a language called love
thats why my breath is felt by the death
and while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess im one of a kind in a full house
cuz whenever i open my heart my soul or my mouth
a touch of god reigns out
who else you know been hot this long

your boy back on his hustle you know what ive been up to
killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips
 last call for alcohol for my niggas
so this ar over at rocafella named hiphop
picked the truth beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
i had my demo with me you know like i always do
i play the songs hes like who that spittin 
im like its me hes like oh well okay
uhh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth
just askin me to send him beats
and im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers
cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with
and um he was friends with my mentor no id
and no id told him look man you wanna mess with kanye
you need to tell him that you like the way he rap
i was all i dunno if he was gassin me or not
but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
 im like oh shit
i was messin with uh ddot also
people were like this started talking about the ghost production
but thats how i got in the game
if it wasnt for that i wouldnt be here
so you know after they picked that truth beat
i was figuring i was gonna do some more work
but shit just wasnt poppin off like that
i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment
i be doin like just beats for local acts
just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy
get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or something
or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this hal melville sample
i played it for hip over the phone hes like oh yo that shit is crazy
jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty
and at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me
so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic  at that time
and really i just like picked the drums off xxplosive and put it like
with it sped up sampled and now its kind of like my whole style
when it started when he rapped on this cant be life
and that was like really the first beat of that kind
that was on the dynasty album i could say that was the
the resurgence of this whole sound
you know i got to come in and track the beat
and at the time i was still with my other management
i really wanted to roll with hiphop
cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im sayin
cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me
but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change
try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat
and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude
 and he uh played the song
cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio
you know how he do it one take and he said
 
tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i was thinking like
man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz
i aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the
in my personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it 
 and i was like man that shit tight
you know what im sayin man what ima tell him i was on the train 
man you know so after that i went back home and man im im just
in chicago im trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got
acts im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like
poppin off the way it should have been one of my homeys that was one
of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through
my production company but he ended up going straight with the
company so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad
news that dude was tryin to leave my company and i got evicted at
the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took
that money came back packed all my shit up in a uhaul maybe about
ten days before i had to actually get out so i aint have to deal
with the landlord cause hes a jerk me and my mother drove to
 newark new jersey i hadnt even
seen my apartment i remember i pulled up mother kanye baby were
here i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a
bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and
the first beat i made was uh heart of the city
and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up
there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i
played like seven beats and you know i could see hes in the zone
he already had the beats that he wanted i did nothing like already at
that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket
hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hiphop said
yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and
really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat
to dmx  and
i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that
gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of
them faces like ooooooooooh two days later im in baseline and i seen
dame dame didnt know who i was and i was like 
yo whats up im kanye  
you that kid that gave all them beats to jay yo this nigga got
classics  you know i aint talkin
shit im like oh shit and all this time im starstruck man im
still thinking bout you know im picturing these niggas on the show
the streets is watching im lookin these were superstars in my
eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all
these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one
thing you know come back to the story the day i did the cant be
life beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton
sneakers on he think he fly and hiphop was there i think tata john
minnelli a bunch of people i didnt know all these people at the
time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i
spit this rap that said uh im killin yall niggas on that lyrical
shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his
eyes light up when i said that line but you know the west the rap
was like real wack and shit so thats all the response he said man
that was tite  that
was it you know i aint get no deal then hehe okay fast
forward so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just
took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship
with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my
career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me
to go on tour with him man i appre i love him for that and at
this time you know i didnt have a deal i had songs and i had
relationships with all these ars and they wanted beats from me so
theyd call me up id play them some beats gimme a beat that sound
like jayz you know they dick riders whatever so ill play them
these postblueprint beats or whatever and then ill play my shit ill
be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy
cause you know cause i aint have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks and they
didnt sign me you know what happened it was some ars that fucked
with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the
company thatll say naw like dave lotti fucked with me my
nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man

who gave saddam anthrax
george bush got the answers

to bein the president look theres hope man
this that inspiration for the moes and the folks man
shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin

my homie mali used to stay th and may
one of my best friends from back in the day
down the street from calumet a school full of stones
he nicknamed me krock so theyll leave me alone
bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
and walked around the mall with his radio face off
plus he had the spinner from his daytons in his hand keys in his hand
reason again to let you know hes the man
back when we rocked alieses he had dreams of caprices
drove by the teachers even more by polices
how he get the cash the day his father passed away
left him with a lil somethin  he was stuntin
al b sure nigga with the hair all wavy
hit lakeshore girls go all crazy
hit the freeway go at least bout 
boned so much that summer even had him a baby
see back back then then if you had a car
you was the chitown version of baby
and i was just a virgin a baby
one of the reasons i looked up to him crazy
i used to love play my demo tape when the system yanked
felt like i was almost signed when the shit got cranked
well take a saturday and just circle the mall
they had they lincolns and auroras we was hurtin em all
with the girls alot of flirtin involved but dog

about these hoes homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
what it do
im posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin
the candy gloss is immaculate its simply amazing
them elbows pokin wide on that candy lac
trunk open screens on neons lit with th relaxed
im on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
allow me to introduce you to my cl mercedes
its a starstudded event when i valet park
open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
you see them s crawlin you see them screens fallin
the disco ball in my mouth insinuates im ballin
im leanin on the switch sittin crooked in my slab
but i could still catches boppers if i drove a cab
a young houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
ridin somethin candycoated crawlin like a caterpillar
im tippin on them s im jammin on that screw
im lookin for them hoes baby what it do
drive slow homie
drive slow homie
drive slow homie
you never know homie
might meet some hoes homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
my cars like the movie my cars like the crib
i got mo tvs in here than where i live
and that dont make no sense but baby im the shit
and everything i flip you know its somethin serious
i got the custom grill i got the bravis rims
i got the baller genetics baby this evidence
you see a player flickin and how you aint convinced
that you should go on and kiss it just a lil bit 
i wearin my custom kicks i got my jesus chain

with that mean lean smokin on that finest cali green
my woodgrain oak im ridin on vogues
my cylinder quiet like tiptoes
i sold os and this i know
when you see them hoes lil homie drive slow echoes
lookin at life through my rearview all the problems i had
could be seen alot clearer after time had passed
known for livin so fast they wonder how he dont crash
with  on the dash he constantly mashin
 they be constantly askin
but me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets
now i aint tryna say that its the way of the masses
but it so hard to change i love this shit with a passion
since me and sigel cuttin classes showin our ass
shootin out in broad day in the middle of traffic
i remember sellin crack faster than i could bag it
just sharin my past wit ya shawty i aint braggin
me and cap got life some other folk got blasted
had a partner odd and after this all happened
its like the only thing that kept a pimp from cryin and laughin
and the lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
i never thought that id make it this far rappin
for introducin the youth to what we now call trappin
considered now a classic whoda imagined
me in milano gettin models in next years fashions
so nowadays they can call me old fashioned
but its way too much cash to see blue lights flashin
so i guess the moral of this here class is
life about who make it now not about who make it the fastest
drive slow homie
dri uh dri slowly send corrections to the typist
 we can make it better
 we can make it better
 we can make it better

but my name is windy and i like blow trees
and from that point i never blow her off
niggaz come from out of town i like to show her off
they like to act tough she like to to em off
and make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
and when i grew up she showed me how to go downtown
in the nighttime her face lit up so astounding
i told her in my heart is where shell always be
she never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
she said it felt like they walked and drove on me
knew i was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me
i guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
she said ye keep makin that keep makin that platinum and gold for me

sometimes i still talk to her but when i talk to her
it always seems like she talkin bout me
she said you left your kids and they just like you
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you and i just got through
talkin bout what niggaz tryin to do just not new

if you feel the way i feel
why dont you wave your hands hand
fresh off the plane im off to baseline
nothin handed out im bout to take mine
round the same time of that blueprint one
and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
id play my little songs in that old back room
hell bob his head and say damn oh thats you
but by the black album i was blacking out
partyin sobs and we had packed a crowd
big brother got his show up at madison square
and im like yeah yeah we gon be there but
not only did i not get a chance to spit it
colleen told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin a little different
and kept little brother at bay at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess ill understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
my big brother was bigs brother
use to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin
begin let the story begin begin
if you feel the way i feel
why wont you wave your hands
have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
not only a client the presidito
hola hovito
the game gettin foul so heres a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped jesus walks now im on the steephole
and we know new jack city got to keep my brother
but to be number one ima beat my brother
on that diamonds remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came thru and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin me
at the grammys i said i inspired me
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it like pickandroll
cuz even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
i guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
but my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gon mingle yo
heh yall know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind im like damn no way
translate espanol no way jose
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gon come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
my big brother was bigs brother
so heres a few words from ya kid brother
if you admire somebody you should go on head tell em
people never get the flowers while they can still smell em
a idol in my eyes god of the game
heart of the city rocafella chain
never be the same never be another
number one young hov also my big brother
my big brother was bigs brother
use to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor and thats where the story ends
toomp killed this shit itunes bonus track
i mean wow you know man
lookin out my loft window my dreams done became true
lookin at the mirror wondering if its the same dude
lookin at my closet wondering if its all about clothes
look right next to me wondering if its all about hoes
hop in the car and asked the onstar where this life goes
and i drive so fast i blur the light post
they say drive slow i say i know
then errrr away i go
and the way i flew
in this year or two
i know this is what god put me here to do
but in this excitement
you just might miss
a shorty with a demo like hey you might like this
and see
he
remind me of me
just a year ago
now he
tellin me
im his hero
i took his cd and asked him what hes lookin for
he said man i dont know maybe a miracle
time they say 
there aint no way
your dreams are gonna see the light of day
dont believe
you can achieve 
whatever youre after
cant we stay
by the simple minds
that wanna hold you down
and in his time
when you
get with
well be not far behind
when you listen to the sermons
better ask the lord for guidance
when we say the many blessings
blessings you havent seen
gonna give him all the glory

you can do anything
look at my injured hand 
my shoulder i know hes been warning me
to stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be
cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be
but a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave
or stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave
but the women be callin me
the liquor be callin me
 cons took a stripper named diamond
and he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds
and the lord is the only one that he can confide in
so i dont know that you think that can deny him
i open up the book and the message is clear
i still be in the hood so the pressure is there
you could grab that fast money just to get out of queens
you could add up the work that they give out to fiends
but that aint gonna work if i say what i mean
cause at the end of the day im trying to get out my dreamsbittersweet
youre gonna be the death of me
i dont want you but i need you
i love you hate you at the very same time
bittersweet
and she claims she only with me for the currency
you cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
and i was too proud to admit that it was hurtin me
id never do that to you at least purposely
we breakin up again we makin up again
but we dont love no more i guess we fuckin then
have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
and you mix them emotions with tequila
and you mix that with a little bad advice
on one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
and you talk about her family her aunts and shit
and she say motherfucker your mommas a bitch
you know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
id never hit a girl but ill shake the shit out of you
but imma be the bigger man
big pimpin like jigga man
oh i guess i figure its
and my niggas said i shouldnt let it worry me
i need to focus on the girls we gettin currently
but i been thinkin and it got me back to sinkin and
this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
now this hennessey
its gonna be the death of me
and i always thought that you having my child was our destiny
but i cant even vibe with you sexually
cause every time that id try you would question me
saying you fucking them girls disrespecting me
you dont see how your lies is affecting me
you dont see how our life was supposed to be
and i never let a nigga get that close to me
and you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
you always gone you always be where them hos will be
and this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
bittersweet 
youre gonna be the death of me 
i dont want you but i need you
i love you hate you at the very same time
see what i want so much should never hurt this bad
never did this before thats what the virgin says
weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says

steam about a hundred and one ls
kites off to jails buying sweats running up in stetson
nigga hat game was special
it matched every black pair of nikes
throwing dice for decimals
the older head bolder head would train a soldier head
make sure he right in the field not a soldier dead
that meant code red
bent off the black skunk
the black dutch back of the old shed
if you cant live you dying
you give or buy in
keep it real or keep it moving keep grinding
keep shining to every young man this is a plan
learn from others like your brothers rae and kanye
 
not for nothing ive forseen it i dream it
i can feel it slowly dripping away from me
no more chances if you blow this you bogus
i will never ever let you live this down down down 
im living in that st century
doing something mean to it

scream from the haters got a nice ring to it
i guess every superhero needs his theme music
 
no one man should have all that power
the clocks ticking i just count the hours

now i embody every characteristic of the egotistic
he know he so fucking gifted
i just needed time alone with my own thoughts
got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
my childlike creativity purity and honesty 
is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
reality is catching up with me
taking my inner child im fightin for custody
but these responsibilities that they entrust in me
as i look down at my diamondencrusted piece thinking

because gods whole card has been thoroughly piqued
and america is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
the youngsters who were programmed 
to continue fucking up woke up one night 
digging paul revere and nat turner as the good guys
america stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
the signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
we learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal 
two long centuries buried in the musty vault 
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
america was a bastard 
the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
whose legs were then spread around the world
and a rapist known as freedom freedoom 
democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary code names 
that preceded the bubblin bubblin bubblin bubblin bubblin 
in the mother countrys crotch

i am the day ice cube met michael jackson
keep em away huh something might happen
this is the making of a masterpiece
so we broke out the chains and told the master peace
some wear a suit and tie they dont wanna remain average

my chain heavy stop in that traffic coppers harass us
the da attack us want us in chains like ba baracus
son a major factor in my decision to be a rapper
was rebellion being antiestablishment was attractive
to a black kid from brooklyn flames got them thangs cooking
land of the juks where the lames get their chains tooken
it aint looking good for you if you a tourist here
sometimes our rhymes are on a frequency that only purists hear
a couple rappers tried to beef with me nobody scared
niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
why i gotta battle rappers i debate scholars
question do it gotta make sensecents if it make dollars
sick visions is living inside our brains
its like a sadomasochistic addicted to whips and chains
figuratively quite literally clinically insane
spit flames when i visit the higher plane
try in vain to ignore it dont buy the chain if you cant afford it
ye them a load of whores by the boards trust
uh that old ball and chain had me chained up for weeks
so of course im off the chain as soon as i hit the streets
and now when we link she saying the games over
i drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
now the new dude she saying that could stay over
should be a chain who goes by the name of choker
thats what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
so the chains on the door im on the way over
but when i came over his only response
was you must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
cause ima eat your food for that chain that i want
cause you be running round like the chain makes the man
so its obvious that he dont know the chain of command
cause my chain commands that kind of respect
and its so chunky that its a pain in the neck
but it came with a check i remember on chaining day
it spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
them chain snatchers are hoping that you aint ready
so dont get distracted keep your aim steady
or therell be a chain reaction since my chains heavy episode brotherly love from

wilderness tours guided by and for the blind
cool rulers standing still sweating through the shade

dead wrong pageantry lottery and games
slight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
the carnival till bell will hustle for the age

 this tiny stone illuminated by a star far gone
only star so large many more
